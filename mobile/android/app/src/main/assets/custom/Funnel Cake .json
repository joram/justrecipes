  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, whisk the milk, egg, sugar and vanilla. In a small bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt. Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and whisk until the batter is smooth and free of lumps. (It should be thick but pourable.) If it’s too thick, add more milk in 1 tablespoon increments, until it’s thin enough to pour in a steady stream.",
    "Pour the oil into a 9- or 10-inch heavy-bottomed pot or Dutch oven fitted with a clip-on fry thermometer and heat over medium-high to 375 degrees. Meanwhile, line a baking sheet or large platter with paper towels and set it by the stove. Pour half the batter (about 2/3 cup) into a small glass measuring cup with a pouring spout. Finally, set a strainer over a small bowl, spoon in a few tablespoons of confectioners’ sugar and set aside. ",
    "When the oil reaches 375 degrees, reduce the heat to medium-low. Working quickly, remove the thermometer and drizzle the batter in the measuring cup into the oil in a steady stream, first making a large circle and then zig-zagging back and forth across the circle to fill it in. Fry for 60 to 90 seconds, until golden brown on the bottom, then use tongs to flip the funnel cake. Fry for an additional 60 to 90 seconds on the second side, then transfer the cake to the paper towel-lined plate to drain. ",
    "Sprinkle the hot funnel cake generously with confectioners’ sugar. Using a slotted spoon, scoop out any pieces of fried batter left in the pot. Clip the thermometer back onto the pot and raise the heat to bring the oil back to 375 degrees. When the oil comes to temperature, repeat the process with the remaining batter to make one more cake. Serve cakes while they’re hot."
