    "In a small saucepan, combine honey and water over medium heat. Bring to a simmer, stirring, until honey is dissolved. Remove from heat and cool completely. To account for evaporation, add a splash of water to bring the total volume of syrup up to 3 fluid ounces, if necessary.",
    "Add 1 cup of ice to a cocktail shaker. Add bourbon, honey syrup and lemon juice. Cover and shake until chilled, 15 to 20 seconds. Fill a rocks glass with remaining ice cubes or 1 large ice sphere and strain cocktail over the ice. Garnish with lemon twist."
