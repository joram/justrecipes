  "instructions": [
    "Rinse the rice in a sieve until the water runs clear. Transfer to a rice cooker along with 2 cups water and cook. Or combine the rice and 2 1/4 cups water in a saucepan, bring to a boil over high, then cover and simmer on low for 15 minutes. Remove from the heat and let stand, covered, for 10 minutes.",
    "While the rice cooks, prepare the ingredients: Peel and finely chop the ginger; stem and thinly slice the mushrooms; trim and thinly slice the scallions; and thinly slice the bacon. Reserve some scallion greens for garnish.",
    "Combine the oil and ginger in a Dutch oven or large, deep nonstick skillet. Turn the heat to medium and cook, stirring often, until the ginger is golden brown and crisp, 3 to 5 minutes. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the ginger to a bowl and reserve.",
    "Add the bacon to the oil and cook, stirring often, until starting to brown, about 2 minutes. Spoon out all but 2 tablespoons fat, then add the mushrooms. Stir, then spread in an even layer and cook undisturbed until the mushrooms brown a bit and the bacon crisps, about 3 minutes.",
    "Add the scallions to the mushrooms. Cook, stirring often, until tender, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Turn the heat to low and stir in the brown sugar and soy sauce, then add the cooked rice all at once. Stir until everything is well mixed. The rice can be covered and kept warm over the lowest heat for up to 1 hour. Stir in the crispy ginger and top with the reserved scallions right before serving."
