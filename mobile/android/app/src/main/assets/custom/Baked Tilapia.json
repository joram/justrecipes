    "Heat the oven to 400 degrees. In a small bowl, stir together the butter, parsley, red-pepper flakes (if using), and salt (about 1 teaspoon Diamond Crystal kosher or ½ teaspoon fine sea salt). Finely grate the garlic and zest the lemon into the bowl, and stir to combine. Cut the lemon into wedges for serving. ",
    "If using fresh tilapia, pat it dry with paper towels. Arrange fish on a parchment-lined sheet pan. Using the back of a spoon, coat the tops of the fish with the butter mixture. Roast until the fish is opaque and flakes easily  in the thickest part when gently pressed, 10 to 12 minutes for fresh or 17 to 22 minutes for frozen. Serve with more parsley on top and lemon wedges for squeezing over the fish."
