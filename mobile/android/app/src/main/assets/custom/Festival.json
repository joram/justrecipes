    "Heat oven to 200 degrees. Line a sheet tray with paper towels and set aside.",
    "In a large bowl, whisk together flour, cornmeal, sugar, salt, baking soda and nutmeg. With a wooden spoon or your hands, mix in just enough milk to create a soft dough, about the same texture of Play-Doh. (The amount you need will depend on the humidity of your kitchen, and the amount of moisture in your flour and cornmeal.)",
    "In a Dutch oven or large pot, heat oil to 365 degrees. While oil heats, using a bench scraper or butter knife, divide dough into 10 pieces. Roll each between your hands or on your counter into cylinders about 3 to 4 inches long and 1 inch thick. (Avoid overworking the dough or the festival may be tough.)",
    "Fry 4 or 5 festival at a time, flipping them after 1 minute, until golden brown on the outside, about 2 minutes total. (Oil temperature will lower once you add festival; they fry best around 330 to 340 degrees. If festival appear to be browning too quickly, lower your burner.) Using a wire spider or slotted spoon, remove festival from oil and transfer to paper towel-lined baking sheet. Cut into one to ensure the inside is cooked all the way through; it should not look wet. If it is not fully cooked, cook each fritter 30 seconds to 1 minute longer. Transfer to oven to keep warm. Fry remaining festival. Serve hot."
