  "instructions": [
    "In a small bowl, combine butter, Demerara sugar (if using), fine sea salt and black pepper (if using), mixing with a spatula until smooth. Using a pastry brush, brush a little of the butter mixture on the sides and bottom of a 9-by-13-inch pan. Set aside.",
    "On a clean, lightly floured surface, roll or pat half (or 1 pound) of the dough into an 8-by-12-inch rectangle. With a pastry brush, brush about 2 tablespoons of the butter mixture over the entire surface of the dough. Fold dough in half to make an 8-by-6-inch rectangle.",
    "Using a bench knife, regular knife or pizza wheel, cut the dough into thirds lengthwise and then thirds crosswise to make 9 pieces. Place them in the buttered pan. Repeat with the remaining half of dough, using about another 2 tablespoons of the butter (you will have 18 rolls). Once all rolls have been shaped and placed in the pan, brush tops generously with about half of the remaining butter, reserving the rest for after baking.",
    "Set aside in a warm place to allow the rolls to proof and rise until very puffy, about 1 to 2 hours. The dough will feel spongy to the touch. When the rolls are nearly proofed, heat oven to 450 degrees.Â ",
    "When the rolls are proofed, sprinkle tops with flaky salt, more Demerara sugar (if using) and lots of cracked black pepper (if using). Bake until firm to the touch and golden brown on top, about 17 to 25 minutes. (If the rolls seem pale and you want more color on the tops, run the pan under the broiler for 30 seconds to 2 minutes.)",
    "Transfer pan to a wire rack to cool for 5 minutes, then brush the rolls with the remaining butter mixture. Cover the pan with aluminum foil (or lay a sheet-pan on top of the pan, or tuck the pan into a plastic bag) to allow the rolls to steam and soften, 10 to 15 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
