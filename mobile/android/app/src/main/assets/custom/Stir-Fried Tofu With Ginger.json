  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the tofu. Using clean hands, crumble the tofu into roughly 1- to 1 ½-inch chunks. There will also be smaller pieces and that is fine. Add the tofu to a large bowl and add the soy sauce, cornstarch,  five-spice powder and pepper. Toss to coat. (This is easiest done with clean hands.) Set aside to marinate for 10 minutes. (You can also leave it to marinate overnight in the fridge.)",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, prepare the stir-fry sauce by combining the light soy sauce, Shaoxing wine, chile oil and sugar.",
    "Heat a wok or large well-seasoned or non-stick skillet over medium high. When hot, add 2 tablespoons of neutral oil, along with the white parts of the scallions and the marinated tofu. Stir fry for 4 to 5 minutes until the tofu starts to brown and the white parts of the scallions are soft.",
    "Add the ginger, green parts of the scallions and the stir-fry sauce and stir for 1 minute until fragrant and the green scallions are just tender.",
    "Transfer to a plate, top with sesame seeds and serve with rice."
