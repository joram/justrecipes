  "instructions": [
    "To make fresh coconut milk, extract the coconut water and coconut meat from the coconut: Hammer a screwdriver into the coconut’s three eyes, and pour the coconut water through a fine-mesh strainer into a blender. Wrap the coconut in a towel to balance it, and crack it open with a hammer or the dull side of cleaver. Remove the tough outer shell, then use a vegetable peeler to remove any remaining brown skin on the coconut meat. Rinse the meat thoroughly, then roughly chop it. Add 2 cups coconut meat and 3 1/2 cups hot water to the blender, and process. Strain through a fine-mesh sieve, pressing at coconut solids with the back of a spoon. Wrap the solids in a piece of cheesecloth, and squeeze firmly with your hands to get every last bit of liquid out. (Reserve coconut solids for another use.)",
    "In a saucepan, combine the cornstarch, sugar and salt, and mix together with a whisk. Lightly whisk the coconut milk if it has separated, then whisk 4 cups coconut milk into the cornstarch mixture. Add the orange-blossom water.",
    "Put the saucepan over medium-high heat, and whisk until the mixture starts to thicken. Lower the heat to medium-low, and continue stirring until a few bubbles start to appear and break on the surface and the mixture is just barely boiling. Remove from heat and immediately pour into 10 dry ramekins, using a scant half cup for each portion.",
    "Allow it to cool at room temperature for about 30 minutes, then cover with plastic wrap, and chill in the refrigerator for at least 2 hours, or until completely cold. Use a small palette knife to release the edges, and tip the tembleque out onto serving dishes (or, alternately, serve directly out of ramekins). Garnish with a dusting of cinnamon."
