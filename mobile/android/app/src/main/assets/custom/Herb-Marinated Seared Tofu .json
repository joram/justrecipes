  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl, stir together the shallot, lemon juice and a pinch of salt; set aside.",
    "In a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet, heat 1 1/2 tablespoons olive oil over medium-high. Season the tofu all over with salt, then add to the skillet and cook until golden brown, 3 to 5 minutes per side. Transfer to a plate or cutting board and let cool slightly",
    "Meanwhile, to the shallot mixture, add the remaining 1/2 cup olive oil, all the fresh herbs you’re using and the red-pepper flakes. Season generously with salt and stir to combine. (For a smoother sauce, blitz everything in a food processor.) ",
    "When the tofu is cool enough to handle, rip it into 1/2-inch pieces and add to the sauce. Stir to combine. Eat right away, let sit at room temperature for up to 2 hours, or refrigerate for up to 3 days. Re-season with salt and lemon juice as needed, as flavors shift from the fridge."
