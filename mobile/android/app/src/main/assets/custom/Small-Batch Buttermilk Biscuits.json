  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt to combine. Add the cold cubed butter, and toss until each cube is well coated with flour. Using your hands or a pastry cutter, cut the butter into the flour until the mixture resembles a coarse meal.",
    "Make a well in the center of the bowl, and pour in the buttermilk. Use your hands or a silicone spatula to mix the ingredients together until they form a homogenous dough. (It will look quite shaggy.) If the dough is not coming together, add more buttermilk by tablespoons.",
    "Wrap the dough in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes. Toward the end of chilling, heat the oven to 400 degrees.",
    "Butter a 9-inch square baking pan, a 9-inch round cake pan, an oven-safe skillet or a baking sheet.",
    "On a lightly floured surface and using floured hands, pat the dough into a rectangle 1/2-inch thick. Fold the dough in quarters. Using floured hands, pat the dough out again to a square about 1 1/4-inch thick.",
    "Cut the square of biscuit dough into four even pieces. Transfer the biscuits to the prepared pan in a cluster, with about 1/2 inch of space between each biscuit.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk the egg with 1 tablespoon water. Brush the egg wash over the surface of the biscuits, and bake until deeply golden brown on top, 25 to 30 minutes. Cool at least 10 minutes before carefully separating and serving."
