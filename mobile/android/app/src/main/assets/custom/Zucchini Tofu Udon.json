    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil, add the udon noodles and cook for about 2 minutes, using wooden chopsticks or tongs to gently loosen the noodles from their tight bundle. Drain, rinse with cold water and leave to continue draining while you prepare the remaining ingredients.",
    "Meanwhile, place the melted butter, fuyu and soy sauce in a bowl and whisk together until smooth. If the mixture looks too thick, add 1 tablespoon of the fuyu brine or water to loosen up the mixture. Set aside.",
    "Heat a large 12-inch skillet or wok on medium high. When hot, add 1 to 2 tablespoons of olive oil, along with the tofu and salt and toss for 2 to 3 minutes until the tofu has released some of its liquid. Add the zucchini and garlic and toss for 2 minutes until it has softened.",
    "Add the udon, the butter-fuyu mixture and black pepper and toss well to combine. Stir-fry for 2 minutes, until the noodles are heated through.",
    "To serve, top with scallions."
