    "In a 6- to 8-quart slow cooker, combine the oats, salt and 4 cups water. Cover and set the cook time to 2 hours on low, at which point the slow cooker will automatically switch to warm. Cook on warm until the oatmeal is creamy and tender, about 6 more hours. (The 6 hours on warm is not optional; the oats will not be done after 2 hours on low. If you wish to cook them more quickly, you can cook for 4 to 5 hours total on low.) Ladle into bowls and serve with the toppings of your choice."
