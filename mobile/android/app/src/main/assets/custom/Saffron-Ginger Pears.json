  "instructions": [
    "Peel the pears, leaving stems intact.",
    "Put wine, sugar, saffron and ginger in a stainless-steel saucepan or skillet just large enough to hold the pears in a single layer over high heat. Stir and bring to a boil.",
    "Add pears and reduce to a simmer. Cover and cook gently for about 20 minutes (turning occasionally if the pears aren’t fully submerged), until pears are just tender when poked with a skewer or a small, sharp knife. If time permits, allow pears to cool in their syrup in the refrigerator, preferably overnight or for up to several days.",
    "Remove pears from syrup. Simmer syrup down to a thick glaze over brisk heat, about 15 minutes. Let cool slightly (about 10 minutes) and pour over pears to serve. Pair with crème fraîche or vanilla ice cream."
