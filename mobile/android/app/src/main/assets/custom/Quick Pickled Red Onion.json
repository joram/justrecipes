  "instructions": [
    "Thinly slice the red onion by halving through the root and slicing in the same direction. Separate the slices by hand, as best you can, without getting too obsessive. Place the onion slices in a heat-proof, wide-mouth jar or container (about 1 pint capacity). It might seem like they won’t fit, but the onion slices will shrink as they pickle. ",
    "Add the salt, sugar, vinegar and ¼ cup water to a small saucepan. Heat over medium-high, stirring to dissolve the salt and sugar. As soon as the mixture comes to a boil, remove from the heat and pour half of the liquid over the onion, pressing down the slices with the back of a spoon. Add the remaining liquid, continuing to press down the slices.",
    "Cover and give the jar a gentle shake. Set aside to pickle for about 30 minutes. Serve right away, or cool to room temperature and place in the fridge in the pickling liquid, covered, for up to 1 week."
