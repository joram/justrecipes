  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium, and add the tapioca or sago. Cook for 10 minutes, stirring every few minutes. Turn off the heat. Cover and let it sit for another 10 to 15 minutes until the pearls are translucent. Drain in a very fine sieve, and rinse them under cold water.",
    "Meanwhile, pour the coconut cream into a medium saucepan, along with the maple syrup or brown sugar, vanilla extract and ½ cup of water. Stir over medium–low heat for 2 minutes until well combined and smooth, then remove from the heat. Add the pearls to the coconut mixture and stir well.",
    "Transfer the sago pudding to a bowl or separate into smaller bowls or glasses. Allow to cool completely, then chill in the fridge for at least 2 hours. It will thicken into a pudding as it cools.",
    "Serve alone or with fresh fruit with a drizzle of maple syrup or a scattering of brown sugar (or another sweetener)."
