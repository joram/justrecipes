  "instructions": [
    "Put the rice, almonds (if using) and 8 cups water into a large pitcher or bowl. Cover container and let soak overnight (at least 8 hours) at room temperature.",
    "Remove 4 cups liquid from the rice and almonds; reserve. Transfer the remaining liquid, rice and almonds to a blender, and blend, in batches if necessary, until solids are finely ground, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Place a fine-mesh strainer over a large bowl and pour the ground rice and almond mixture into the strainer. Use a spoon to press the solids to extract as much liquid as possible. (You could also strain the liquid through a cheesecloth if you want your horchata to be extra smooth.) Discard the solids. Transfer the strained liquid to a large pitcher (or keep it in the bowl) and mix in the reserved 4 cups liquid from Step 2.",
    "Add sugar and cinnamon, and stir well. Serve over ice and dust with ground cinnamon, if desired."
