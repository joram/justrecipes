    "Preheat oven to 400 degrees. Line a baking sheet with parchment.",
    "Sift together flours, baking powder, baking soda, sugar and salt. Rub in butter, or place in a stand mixer fitted with the paddle and beat at low speed until incorporated. Add chopped rosemary and thyme and buttermilk and mix just until the dough comes together.",
    "Transfer to a lightly floured work surface and gently shape into a 1/2-inch thick rectangle. Either cut 2-inch circles with a biscuit cutter or cut into 6 squares, then cut each square in half on the diagonal. Transfer to baking sheet. Bake 15 minutes, until browned on the bottom. Flip over, bake 2 more minutes, and remove from the heat. Serve warm or allow to cool."
