  "instructions": [
    "Heat a gas or charcoal fire; it should be quite hot, with the rack positioned 4 to 6 inches from the source of heat.",
    "Combine the sugar, fresh ginger and 1/2 cup of water in a small saucepan over medium heat. Bring to a boil, and simmer for 3 minutes. Remove from the heat, and let sit while preparing the fruit. (Refrigerate if you're not using this right away; it will keep for at least a week.)",
    "Cut the unpeeled bananas into 2-inch-long chunks, and make a shallow vertical slit in the skin for peeling at the table. Peel and core the pineapple, then cut it into 2-inch chunks. If you're using starfruit, cut it into slices 1/2 inch thick.",
    "Skewer the fruit. Strain the syrup, and brush it on the fruit lightly. Grill the fruit until the pineapple is nicely browned, 2 to 4 minutes to a side. While it is grilling, brush it occasionally with the syrup.",
    "When the fruit is done, brush once more with syrup. Serve hot or warm."
