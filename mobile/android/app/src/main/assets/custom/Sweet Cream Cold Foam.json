    "In a deep cup or bowl, combine heavy whipping cream, milk and simple syrup.",
    "With a handheld electric milk frother, whisk until almost doubled in volume, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, whisk by hand or with a hand mixer for 3 to 5 minutes or add to a mason jar, cover and shake vigorously for 2 to 3 minutes. These methods will produce a slightly softer, less fluffy foam.)",
