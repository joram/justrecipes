Add ½ teaspoon of lemon zest and 1 tablespoon of lemon juice, and season with salt (about 1 teaspoon). Stir to combine and taste for seasoning. Be mindful not to oversalt if you plan to serve this with salty chips. Serve right away or transfer back to the container, cover and store in the fridge for up to 1 day. "
