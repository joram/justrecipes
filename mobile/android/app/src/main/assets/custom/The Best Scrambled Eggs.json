    "Crack the eggs into a bowl and beat them, just until  the yolks and whites are combined. Season with salt and pepper and beat in the  cream.",
    "Put a medium skillet, preferably non-stick, over medium heat for about 1 minute. Add the butter or oil and swirl it around the pan. After the butter melts, but before it foams, turn the heat to low.",
    "Add the eggs to the skillet and cook over low heat, stirring occasionally with a wooden spoon. At first nothing will happen; after 10 minutes or so, the eggs will begin to form curds. Do not lose patience: Keep  stirring, breaking up the curds as they form, until the mixture is a mass of  soft curds. This will take 30 minutes or more. Serve  immediately."
