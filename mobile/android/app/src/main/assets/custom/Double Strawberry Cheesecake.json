  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: In the bowl of an electric mixer or a food processor, cream together butter and brown sugar until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in honey.",
    "In a separate bowl, whisk together flours, cocoa, salt and cinnamon. With mixer running on low speed or using the pulse button on the food processor, add dry ingredients to butter mixture in two batches. Scrape dough onto a sheet of plastic wrap. Flatten into a disk and chill for at least 2 hours or overnight.",
    "Place dough round between two sheets of parchment or wax paper. Working quickly, roll out dough to a thickness of 1/8 inch. If dough becomes sticky, chill in refrigerator until firm. Transfer dough to an 8- or 9-inch springform pan. Press into bottom of pan and 2/3 up the sides (don’t worry if the sides aren’t even). Prick bottom with a fork. Refrigerate 20 minutes.",
    "Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place pan on a baking sheet and transfer it to oven; bake until crust is golden and dry to touch, about 25 minutes. Cool completely on a wire rack.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Put red wine in a small saucepan and sprinkle gelatin on top. Let rest for 5 minutes, until absorbed. Put pan over low heat and stir until gelatin dissolves. Don’t let gelatin boil, which impedes its gelling power. Let cool.",
    "In a food processor or electric mixer, combine cream cheese, granulated sugar and goat cheese; blend until smooth. Stop once or twice to scrape down sides of bowl and blend again. Add chopped berries and gelatin mixture and blend until incorporated (berries will break down to a purée, which is fine). Scrape mixture into cooled crust; cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate until set, at least 6 hours or overnight. Top with sliced or whole strawberries before serving."
