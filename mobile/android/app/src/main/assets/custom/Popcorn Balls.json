  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 200 degrees with the rack in the center position. If using mix-ins, place them in individual bowls and set aside. If using microwave popcorn or kernels, pop according to package instructions. (you should have about 18 cups). Transfer popped popcorn to a sheet pan, picking out any unpopped kernels, and place them in the oven to keep warm.",
    "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, combine the confectioners’ sugar, marshmallows, corn syrup, butter, 1 tablespoon cold water, salt and food coloring, if using. Bring to a boil, stirring frequently, until the marshmallows melt and the mixture is smooth, 6 to 9 minutes. Remove from the heat. ",
    "Transfer the popcorn to a mixing bowl large enough to comfortably hold all of the popcorn. Carefully add the hot marshmallow mixture, mixing gently with a spatula from the bottom of the bowl to ensure the popcorn is evenly coated. Allow the popcorn to cool slightly so the mixture doesn’t burn your hands and the popcorn balls don’t fall apart when shaping, about 5 minutes. ",
    "Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Grease a 1/2 cup measuring cup and your hands with butter. Fill the measuring cup with the popcorn mixture; transfer to your hands and shape into a ball by gently squeezing it together. Place the ball on the sheet pan and continue with the rest, greasing your hands as needed. (You’ll need to work fairly quickly so the mixture doesn’t get cold. If the popcorn balls start to fall apart slightly on the sheet pan, don’t panic. Give them another little squeeze.) If you’d like to add any candies, stick them in once you’ve formed a ball (see Tip). If using sprinkles, place them in a bowl, then roll the popcorn balls in the sprinkles.",
    "Once cool, wrap each popcorn ball in plastic wrap and store on the counter for up to 3 days. Do not refrigerate. "
