    "Peel the limes: Slice off the tops and bottoms then, working with one at a time, place each one vertically on a cutting board, setting it on one flat, cut side. Next, slice off the skin and pith. Repeat with remaining limes.",
    "Put peeled limes, ice cubes, kala namak, fine sea salt and sugar, if using, in a blender, along with 3 cups of water. Blend on high until the ice is crushed and the nimbu pani is frothy.",
    "Strain, then serve in a glass with a sprig of mint, if you like."
