    "Heat the butter in a light-colored high-sided 10- to 12-inch skillet on medium heat until it has melted and is frothy, about 5 minutes. Reduce the heat to low and skim the froth from the top using a ladle, large spoon or mesh skimmer.Â ",
    "Continue cooking on low until the solids in the butter have sunk to the bottom of the pan and have browned, about 15 minutes.",
    "Using a fine-mesh sieve or a double layer of fine cheesecloth set over a strainer, strain the ghee into a heat proof jar. To store, let cool to room temperature, about 1 1/2 hours, then cover and refrigerate."
