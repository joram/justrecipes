    "Place oven rack on the top third of the oven and heat to 425 degrees.",
    "Combine chickpeas, fennel seed, cumin, remaining teaspoon of turmeric and half the red onion slices on a rimmed baking sheet. Drizzle with olive oil, season with salt and pepper and toss to coat.",
    "Move chickpeas to the outer edges of the baking sheet. Scrape any excess marinade off the chicken, and place the chicken parts in the center. Place baking sheet in oven and bake, tossing chickpeas occasionally, until the skin of the chicken is evenly browned and the chickpeas are golden and starting to crisp, 45 to 50 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, toss remaining onion slices with 2 tablespoons lemon juice and season with salt and pepper; set aside.",
    "Combine remaining yogurt with remaining 1 tablespoon lemon juice and season with salt and pepper; set aside.",
    "Once chicken is ready, scatter with lemony onions and mint or cilantro. Serve with seasoned yogurt alongside as a sauce."
