  "instructions": [
    "In the bowl of an asanka (or in a mortar with a rough finish inside the bowl), combine the Scotch bonnet, ginger, garlic and a pinch of salt, and crush to a rough paste, 1 minute.",
    "Cut the onion half in half: Thinly slice one quarter and reserve. Roughly chop the remaining quarter and add to the asanka (or mortar). Crush into the chile paste, about 2 minutes. Add the tomatoes and crush using the mortar. Salt the relish to taste. Stir in the sliced onions. You should have about 1 cup of the relish. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the chile, ginger and garlic until coarsely chopped. Add the onion quarter or shallot, and chop. Add the tomato pieces and chop. Season with salt and stir in the sliced onions.)",
    "Slice along the length of each egg, just enough to open it up but without cutting all the way through. Season the insides with a pinch of salt. Carefully stuff each egg with about 1 tablespoon spicy relish. Arrange the eggs on a plate or serving platter, and serve immediately."
