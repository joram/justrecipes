  "instructions": [
    "Combine the soy sauce, water, sugar, scallions, chile (if using) and 1/2 to 2/3 cup water in a skillet just large enough to hold the fish. Turn the heat to medium high, and bring to a boil.",
    "Add the fish, and adjust the heat so the mixture bubbles but not furiously. Cook 8 to 10 minutes, turning once or twice, until the fish is coated with a brown glaze and cooked through. Serve with white rice, spooning the sauce over all and garnishing with the scallions."
