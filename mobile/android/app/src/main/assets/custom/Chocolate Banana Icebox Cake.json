  "instructions": [
    "Place a fine-mesh sieve over a medium bowl, and set it aside. ",
    "In a medium saucepan, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and salt. Add the milk, little by little, while whisking to incorporate it fully. Whisk in the egg yolks. Heat the mixture over medium, stirring constantly, until it has thickened and just come to a low boil, about 4 to 5 minutes. Continue to cook the custard while whisking for another minute, then immediately pour it into the sieve, pushing it through with a small spatula. Stir in the vanilla.",
    "Chill the custard until it reaches room temperature or colder, about 1 1/2 hours. (To speed the process, you can spread the custard into an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Stir often until the custard has cooled, about 10 minutes. Transfer the custard back to the medium bowl.)",
    "Whip the 3/4 cup heavy cream to stiff peaks. Fold the cream into the custard.",
    "Add about 1/2 cup of custard to the bottom of a 2-quart serving dish, spreading it in an even layer. Top with a layer of cookies (about 15), breaking them as needed to fit the edges. Slice the bananas 1/4-inch thick, and top the cookies with a layer of bananas.",
    "Dollop 1/3 of the remaining custard on top of the bananas and, using an offset spatula, gently spread it into an even layer until the bananas are completely covered. Repeat the layering of cookies, bananas and custard two more times, finishing with custard.",
    "Cover with plastic wrap and chill until the custard is cold and the cookies have softened, at least 4 hours or up to 24 hours.",
    "To serve, whip the 1 1/2 cups heavy cream and confectioners’ sugar to medium-stiff peaks. Top the pudding with the whipped cream, and sprinkle with cocoa powder, dusting it through a fine-mesh sieve. Serve cold."
