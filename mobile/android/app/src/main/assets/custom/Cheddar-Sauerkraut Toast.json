    "In the oven or toaster oven, heat the broiler to high with a rack 6 or fewer inches from the heat source. Place the bread on a foil-lined baking sheet or tray. Broil until toasted, 1 to 2 minutes per side. (Watch closely as broilers and breads vary.)",
    "Top each slice of bread evenly with the sauerkraut, followed by the jalape√±os, then the cheese. Spread the toppings all the way to the edge of the bread to prevent burning.",
    "Broil until the cheese is bubbling and browned in spots, 3 to 5 minutes. Let cool slightly, then dig in."
