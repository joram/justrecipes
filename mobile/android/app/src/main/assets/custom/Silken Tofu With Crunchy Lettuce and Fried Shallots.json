  "instructions": [
    "In a large (12-inch) skillet, add the shallot, half the jalape単o slices and the oil. Sprinkle with salt, then set over high heat. Once sizzling, reduce heat to medium and cook, stirring occasionally with a fork, until golden, 4 to 6 minutes. Remove from heat, then use a slotted spoon or fish spatula to transfer shallot and jalape単o slices to a paper towel-lined plate. Leave the oil in the skillet.",
    "To the skillet, add the lettuce, remaining jalape単o, vinegar and soy sauce. Toss until the lettuce is slicked with dressing and just barely wilted. (You want to maintain most of its crunch.) Season to taste with salt.",
    "Invert the tofu onto a large platter (or divide among four plates). Using a knife or spoon, break the tofu into large chunks. Top with the wilted lettuce and any dressing from the skillet, then sprinkle with the fried shallots and jalape単o. Eat right away."
