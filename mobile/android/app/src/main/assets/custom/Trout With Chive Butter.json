    "Heat the broiler. Place trout, skin side down, on a rimmed baking sheet. Sprinkle with salt.",
    "In a mini food processor, or using a mortar and pestle or a bowl and a fork, stir together garlic, lemon juice, pepper and a pinch of salt. Add softened butter and chives and mash or process until well mixed.",
    "Broil trout until just opaque, 2 to 5 minutes depending upon your broiler.",
    "Drop spoonfuls of butter on top of the fish; it will melt immediately. Top with more chives and with roe or capers, and a little more lemon juice if you like."
