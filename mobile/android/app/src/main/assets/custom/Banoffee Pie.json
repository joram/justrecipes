  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Make the crust: In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, melted butter, sugar and salt. Stir until fully incorporated and sandy. (When you pinch a bit of it between your fingers, it should hold together.) Transfer to a 9-inch pie plate. Using your fingers or a flat-bottomed cup, press the mixture into the pie plate and up the sides. Make sure it is well packed. Bake until set, 12 to 15 minutes. Let cool at room temperature for 30 minutes, or cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate up to 2 days.",
    "Spoon the dulce de leche into the pie crust and spread into an even layer. Pile in banana slices into a relatively even layer (they should overlap). Transfer the pie to the refrigerator while you make the whipped cream.",
    "Make the whipped cream: Using a handheld mixer or stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment, whip the heavy cream, sugar, vanilla extract and instant coffee, if using, on medium-high speed until firm peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes. Spread the whipped cream on top of the bananas, making sure to spread the whipped cream to the edge, totally covering the bananas (this will help prevent them from browning). Chill the pie, uncovered, for 2 hours and up to overnight.",
    "To serve, sprinkle the pie with chocolate shavings or fresh coffee grounds, if desired. Store leftover pie in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 5 days. The whipped cream may lose some height, but the pie will be no less delicious."
