    "Fill a saucepan three-quarters of the way with water, salt generously and bring to a boil.",
    "Add the farro to the boiling water, decrease heat to maintain a simmer and cook until tender but still chewy, with a similar texture to al dente pasta, 15 to 20 minutes for pearled, 20 to 25 minutes for semi-pearled and 50 to 60 minutes for whole. (Timing can vary widely across brands because pearling isnâ€™t standardized, so tasting is the best way to see if the farro is done.)",
    "Rinse under cold water to remove exterior starch. If using the farro cold for salads, spread it out on a baking sheet to cool to help prevent clumping. Cooked farro will keep in the fridge for up to 5 days. To freeze, place the sheet pan of cooled farro in the freezer; once firm, transfer farro to a freezer bag and freeze for up to 3 months."
