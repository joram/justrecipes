  "instructions": [
    "Using your hands (or a whisk), combine the flour, salt and baking powder in a medium bowl.",
    "In a large bowl, beat the vegetable shortening with your hand in circular motions to warm it up and spread it in the bottom of the bowl, until it is creamed and there are no lumps, about 1 minute. Add the flour mixture and mix it with the shortening, in circular motions, wiping the bowl as you mix, until the fat is evenly distributed through the flour, for about 1 or 2 minutes.",
    "Distribute the water over the mixture and mix it into the flour in a circular motion, scraping from the bottom and folding and kneading the dough pressing it from the center out to the edges of the bowl. At first it will be very sticky and lumpy, but as you continue to knead, it will become more elastic, soft and homogenous, more light, less dense and springy to the touch, 3 to 4 minutes. Cover the bowl with a towel and let rest for 20 minutes.",
    "Using your fingers, pinch off a heaping 1 1/2-inch ball of the dough. (You should have about 12 pieces, each about 70 grams.) Roll each piece into a ball and place on a baking sheet or board. Rub a bit of vegetable shortening in the palm of your hands and roll each ball of dough between your palms to coat it with the shortening. You may need to repeat adding vegetable shortening to your hands about 4 to 5 times to go over the 12 balls. Cover with a towel and let rest for 20 minutes.",
    "Heat your comal, griddle, or cast-iron or nonstick skillet over medium-low heat for at least 5 minutes.",
    "Lightly flour your work surface and your rolling pin. Roll one ball into a 9-inch tortilla. You will need to rotate the tortilla on your work surface about 5 or 6 times as you roll it out, flip and add more flour as needed. Do not get discouraged if the tortilla doesn’t make a perfect round; it takes lots of practice!",
    "As soon as you are done rolling out a tortilla, using both hands, lay it on the hot comal, in a swift and determined way so it doesn’t break. After 40 to 50 seconds there should be brown freckles on the bottom side and air bubbles on top. Using a spatula and your hand, flip the tortilla over and cook for another 40 to 50 seconds, until the other side is freckled and the tortilla puffs up even more. Transfer to a clean kitchen towel and keep covered.",
    "Repeat with the remaining dough and as you cook the tortillas. If you don’t eat all of them at once, let them cool then place them in a plastic bag and seal the bag. They will keep fresh, out of the refrigerator for at least 3 to 4 days. You can also store them in your refrigerator for up to a week. When ready to eat, take them out and reheat on a preheated comal, griddle or skillet over medium low heat, for a minute or so per side. (It is very important that you preheat the comal or skillet before adding the tortillas so that they don’t stick or burn.)"
