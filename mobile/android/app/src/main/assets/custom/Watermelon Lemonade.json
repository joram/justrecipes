    "Peel the watermelon and cut the flesh into large chunks. Purée them in a blender until smooth. Pour the purée through a fine-mesh strainer, and discard the solids.",
    "Pour the strained watermelon into an ice-cube tray (plastic, not silicon). Freeze until solid.",
    "Make simple syrup: In a small saucepan combine sugar with 1 cup water, and place over medium heat. Cook, stirring, until sugar dissolves. Remove from heat and chill.",
    "In another pot bring 6 cups water to a boil. Remove from heat, and add lemon rinds and pulp. Cover, let steep for 10 minutes and then strain.",
    "Combine strained liquid in a pitcher with lemon juice. Refrigerate until ready to serve. (Fruit mixture and simple syrup can be refrigerated separately for a couple of days, until needed.)",
    "Before serving, add simple syrup to taste, and add vodka to make it boozy if you like. Serve in glasses over the watermelon ice cubes."
