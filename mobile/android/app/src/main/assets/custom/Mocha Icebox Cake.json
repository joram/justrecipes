  "instructions": [
    "Line a 9-by-5-inch inch loaf pan with 2 crossed strips of plastic wrap that hang generously over all 4 sides.",
    "Add the heavy cream, confectioners’ sugar, espresso powder, cinnamon, nutmeg and salt to a large bowl. Use an electric mixer to whip the mixture to soft peaks.",
    "Scoop about 2 cups of the cream mixture into the loaf pan and smooth into an even layer.",
    "Scoop a heaping tablespoon of cream onto one side of each wafer cookie and layer them tightly into the loaf pan from one long side of the pan to the other, creating 3 to 4 rows of about 10 cookies each. (The cookies should be standing upright on their round edges, so when you cut into the finished cake crosswise, you’ll get a nice striped pattern.) You may also have a few extra cookies.",
    "Spoon the remaining cream over the top of the cookies, making sure to spread the cream all of the way to the edges of the pans. Tap the pan lightly on the counter to help the cream settle in between the cookies. If you have any cookies remaining, you can place them, flat in one layer, over the top of the cream.",
    "Wrap the cake tightly in the overhanging plastic wrap, press gently and refrigerate at least overnight and up to 2 days. Freeze for 1 hour before serving for easier slicing.",
    "When you are ready to serve, unwrap the top of the cake and turn it out upside-down onto a serving platter. Remove the plastic wrap and lightly drag a spoon over the cake in a decorative pattern. Dust with cocoa powder, if using. Slice crosswise and serve. Wipe the knife in between cuts for the tidiest slices. If the cake is slightly frozen, let it warm up a bit before serving. You can also scoop it from the pan with a spoon for more casual serving."
