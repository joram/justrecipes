  "instructions": [
    "Trim the tops from the radishes, leaving 1/4 inch of green stem. Cut off the roots at the base of each radish, then cut radish in half from top to bottom. Soak radishes in a large bowl of lukewarm water, agitating them to loosen any clinging sand. Drain and rinse, then soak them in cold water. Soak and rinse a third time if necessary.",
    "Put radishes in a wide skillet and season well with salt and pepper. Add butter and 1 cup of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover and reduce heat to a brisk simmer. Cook radishes until tender when pierced but no further, about 5 minutes.",
    "Remove lid, raise heat and boil to evaporate most of the liquid. Serve in the buttery juices with sprinkling of dill."
