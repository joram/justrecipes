  "instructions": [
    "Whisk together flour and salt in a small bowl.",
    "Beat together butter and sugar in a large bowl with an electric mixer at medium-high until pale and fluffy, about 3 minutes in a stand mixer or 6 minutes with a hand mixer. Beat in egg and vanilla. Reduce speed to low and add dry ingredients, mixing until just combined.",
    "Form dough into 2 balls and flatten each into a 6-inch disk. Chill disks, wrapped in plastic wrap, until firm, at least 1 hour.",
    "Put oven rack in middle position and preheat oven to 350°F.",
    "Roll out 1 disk of dough (keep remaining dough chilled) into an 8½-inch round (¼ inch thick) on a well-floured surface with a well-floured rolling pin. (If dough becomes too soft to roll out, rewrap in plastic and chill until firm.) Cut out as many cookies as possible from dough with cutters and transfer to 2 ungreased large baking sheets, arranging cookies about 1 inch apart.",
    "Bake cookies, 1 sheet at a time, until edges are golden, 10 to 12 minutes, then transfer to racks to cool completely.",
    "Meanwhile, gather scraps and chill until dough is firm enough to reroll, 10 to 15 minutes. Make more cookies with remaining dough and scraps (reroll scraps only once) and bake on cooled baking sheets.\nDo Ahead: Dough can be chilled up to 3 days. Baked cookies keep, layered between sheets of wax paper or parchment, in an airtight container at room temperature 1 week.",
    "Beat together all ingredients except food coloring in a large bowl with an electric mixer at moderate speed until just combined, about 1 minute. Increase speed to high and beat icing, scraping down side of bowl occasionally, until it holds stiff peaks, about 3 minutes in a standing mixer or 4 to 5 minutes with a handheld.\nNote: If you plan to spread (rather than pipe) icing on cookies, stir in more water, 1 teaspoon at a time, to thin to desired consistency.",
    "Transfer ¼ cup icing to a small bowl for each color and tint with food coloring. Spoon each color icing into a sealable bag, pressing out excess air, and snip a ⅛-inch opening in 1 bottom corner of bag. Twisting bag firmly just above icing, decoratively pipe icing onto cookies. Decorate with sanding sugar and dragées, if using. Let icing dry completely (about 1 hour) before storing cookies. \n\nEditor’s note: This recipe was originally published in the December 2005 issue of ‘Gourmet’ and first appeared online in November 2005.
