  "instructions": [
    "Melt the butter in a large pot over medium meat. Add the onion, carrots and celery and cook, stirring occasionally, until the vegetables start to soften, about 12 minutes. Add the garlic and thyme and cook until fragrant, 1 minute more.",
    "Add the broth, 1 teaspoon salt, and a few grinds (or shakes) of black pepper, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Stir in the noodles, then lower the heat and simmer uncovered, stirring occasionally, until they’re tender, about 10 minutes. Stir in the turkey and parsley; cook until the meat is just heated. ",
    "Add the gravy, if using, then taste and season with more salt and pepper, if desired. Serve hot with a sprinkle of parsley."
