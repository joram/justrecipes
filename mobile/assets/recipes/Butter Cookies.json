  "instructions": [
    "Sift 2 cups (250 g) all-purpose flour, ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt, and ¼ tsp. baking powder into a medium bowl; set aside.",
    "Beat 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, softened, in a large bowl with an eclectic mixer (a stand mixer with paddle attachment or hand mixer both work) on medium speed mixer until creamy, about 2 minutes. Gradually add 1 cup (200 g) granulated sugar, beating until mixture is light and fluffy, 2–3 minutes. Add 1 large egg and 1 tsp. vanilla extract and beat until combined well. Gradually add flour mixture, beating on low speed until mixture just forms a dough.",
    "Divide dough between 2 large sheets of wax paper and form each half into a 10x1½\" log, wrapping it in wax paper. Chill logs until firm, at least 4 hours, and up to 5 days.",
    "Place rack in middle of oven; preheat oven to 375°F. Line a large rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper and lightly butter the paper. Cut dough into ⅛\"-thick slices and arrange slices about ½\" apart on baking sheet. Bake cookies in batches in middle of oven until golden around edges, 10–12 minutes, and transfer with a metal spatula to a wire rack to cool.\nDo ahead: Dough may be frozen, wrapped in foil, 2 months. Let dough soften slightly before cutting. Cookies may be baked, cooled, and transferred to an airtight container; store at room temperature up to 5 days. \n\nEditor’s note: This recipe for butter cookies was first printed in the February 1999 issue of ‘Gourmet.’ Looking for decorated sugar cookies?
