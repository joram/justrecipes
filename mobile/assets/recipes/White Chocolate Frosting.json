    "In a small saucepan over very low heat, melt the white chocolate until smooth, stirring constantly. Allow the pan to stand on the counter for 10 minutes to cool down to room temperature.",
    "Blend in the shortening with a handheld mixer. Place the saucepan in the refrigerator for 20 minutes, until the frosting is slightly chilled and thickened.",
    "Use immediately or store in a glass Mason jar in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Before using, set the frosting on the counter for 1 to 2 hours, to allow it to come to room temperature, then stir with a flexible spatula until spreadable. This frosting works best at room temperature."
