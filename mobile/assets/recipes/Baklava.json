  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the honey syrup: In a small saucepan, combine 1 cup water with the sugar and honey. Bring to a gentle boil over medium-high heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar dissolves. Reduce heat to low, add the lemon peel and simmer, stirring occasionally, until the syrup thickens enough to coat the back of a spoon, about 15 minutes. Remove and discard the lemon peel, then stir in the orange blossom water (if using). Set syrup aside to cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate until cold, at least 1 hour or up to 24 hours.",
    "About 20 minutes before assembling the baklava, remove the thawed phyllo from the refrigerator to bring it to room temperature. (Do not remove the phyllo from its wrapped packaging until ready to use or it will dry out.)",
    "Prepare the filling: Place half the walnuts in a food processor and pulse until finely chopped. Transfer to a medium bowl and repeat with the remaining walnuts. Mix the sugar and cinnamon into the walnuts.",
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees with the rack in the center position. Melt the butter and set aside to cool slightly. Lightly dampen a clean kitchen towel or a couple of layers of paper towels to cover the phyllo and keep it moist.",
    "Assemble the baklava: Generously brush the bottom and sides of a 9-by-13-inch baking dish with some of the melted butter. Open 1 sleeve of phyllo and carefully unroll it. Place the baking dish on top of the phyllo and, with a sharp knife or kitchen shears, trim the phyllo as needed to fit the baking dish. Cover the phyllo immediately with the damp towel.",
    "Lay 2 phyllo sheets on the bottom of the baking dish. Generously brush the top layer with the melted butter. Lay another 2 sheets on top and brush with more butter, repeating until the first sleeve of dough is used and covering the unused sheets with the damp towel in between layering. (It’s OK if a little dough tears.)",
    "Using a large spoon, scatter the chopped nuts evenly across the top and gently pack it down. Open the second sleeve of phyllo and trim as needed. Repeat layering as before, with 2 sheets of phyllo and butter, on top of the nuts, until all the dough has been used.",
    "Fill a small bowl with cold water. Using the tip of a very sharp knife (a serrated knife works well), first score the pastry as a guide. Make 6 to 7 even cuts along the length of the short side of the pan (each about 1 1/2 to 2 inches apart, depending on how large you’d like the baklava pieces). Next, make diagonal cuts, about 1 inch apart, for diamond shapes. (Alternatively, you can simply cut the baklava into squares.) After the pastry is scored, repeat the cuts, this time slicing right through to the bottom of the pan so each piece can be easily removed once baked and cooled. (To help hold down the dough while cutting, dip your fingertips opposite of your slicing hand into the bowl of cold water.)",
    "Bake until the baklava is deeply golden, 35 to 50 minutes, rotating the baking dish halfway. Starting at the 35-minute mark, check on the baklava every 5 minutes to monitor doneness.",
    "Remove from the oven and immediately pour the cold syrup evenly over the hot baklava, including the corners. Set aside to cool completely before the pieces are removed from the pan. Baklava is best served after it has rested and the syrup has been fully absorbed, 4 to 6 hours. Cover and store at room temperature for 3 days, after which you can transfer to the fridge for up to 1 week."
