  "instructions": [
    "Pat the pork dry and season all over with the sugar and 1 teaspoon salt. In a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet, heat the oil over medium. Add the pork chops, cover with a lid or baking sheet, and cook until browned on the outside and the internal temperature is between 110 and 120 degrees, 4 to 5 minutes per side. Reduce the heat if burning or sizzling wildly.",
    "Using tongs, stack both chops on top of one another, then grab both chops together and hold upright to sear the fat caps until crisp, about 1 minute. Lay the chops back down in one layer and add the butter, paprika and fennel seeds. Season the butter with salt and pepper. Tilt the skillet and baste the pork by spooning the melting butter and drippings over the pork until the internal temperature registers 130 degrees, 1 to 2 minutes per side.",
    "Transfer the pork chops to a lipped plate and pour the butter over top. Let rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving with a spoonful of the butter."
