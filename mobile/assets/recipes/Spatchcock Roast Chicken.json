  "instructions": [
    "Prepare your setup: Set a wire rack into a rimmed sheet pan. Combine several generous pinches of salt in a small bowl with lots of black pepper. (Have more seasoning than you’ll need for easy sprinkling and to avoid cross-contamination with the rest of your salt and pepper.) Have paper towels and kitchen shears handy. If you plan to cook the chicken right away, make a bed for it to roast on by lining the wire rack with the aromatics of your choice. Heat the oven to 450 degrees.",
    "Spatchcock the chicken: Place the chicken on a cutting board, breast side down. Using kitchen shears or poultry shears, cut along both sides of the backbone to remove it. (Save the backbone for stock, or roast it alongside the chicken to gnaw on.) Flip the bird and press firmly on the breast until it flattens and you hear the wishbone crack. Pat dry with paper towels.",
    "Season and roast the chicken: If roasting right away, rub the chicken with the oil, then evenly and generously sprinkle the salt and pepper mixture all over the chicken. Place the chicken on the bed of aromatics and roast until an instant-read thermometer registers at least 160 degrees at the thickest part of the breast and leg, or the juices run clear when pierced with a knife at the leg joint, 40 to 45 minutes.",
    "If you’re dry brining: Evenly and generously sprinkle the salt and pepper mixture all over the chicken. Place on a wire rack and refrigerate uncovered for 6 to 24 hours. When ready to cook, heat the oven to 450 degrees and arrange a bed of aromatics under the chicken. Rub the chicken with the oil and roast until an instant-read thermometer registers at least 160 degrees at the thickest part of the breast and leg, or the juices run clear when pierced with a knife at the leg joint, 40 to 45 minutes.",
    "Let rest, uncovered, for 10 minutes, then carve and serve."
