  "instructions": [
    "Lightly spray a 9-inch pie plate with nonstick spray.",
    "In the bowl of a food processor, pulse the cookies into fine crumbs, about 1 minute. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups.) Add the melted butter and pulse until the mixture is uniformly combined and sticks together when pressed, 15 to 20 seconds. Press the crust evenly into the base and up the sides of the pie plate. Freeze the crust while you heat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Bake the chilled crust until it appears set and the edges start to darken slightly, 8 to 10 minutes. Cool completely.",
    "In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whisk attachment, beat the cream cheese and cookie butter on medium speed, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl, then add the confectionersâ€™ sugar and mix on low speed until fully incorporated, 1 to 2 minutes. Scrape down the sides of the bowl.",
    "In a liquid measuring cup with a spout, mix the 1 1/4 cups cream with the vanilla and salt to combine. Increase the mixer speed to medium and gradually add the cream mixture to the cream cheese mixture in a slow, steady stream. Continue to mix just until the mixture has thickened and holds medium peaks, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Do not overwhip, which could cause the mixture to separate.",
    "Pour the filling into the cooled pie crust and smooth into an even layer. Freeze the pie for 20 minutes to set the filling, then transfer to the refrigerator to chill until the filling is firm, about 45 minutes.",
    "Prepare the whipped cream, if using: In the bowl of an electric mixer fitted with the whip attachment, whip the remaining 3/4 cup cream to medium peaks. Spread in an even layer on top of the chilled pie and garnish with a sprinkling of cookie crumbs, if desired. Refrigerate until ready to serve."
