  "instructions": [
    "Trim the zucchini lengthwise on two opposite sides to create flat edges. Discard the scraps and cut the zucchini in half lengthwise into two planks that are about ½-inch thick. (If you’re using larger zucchini, you may get three planks from each one.) Pat them dry with a paper towel, pressing gently but firmly on both sides to absorb any moisture.",
    "Heat a large (12-inch) cast-iron or stainless-steel skillet over medium-high. Add the oil and heat until it’s almost smoking. Add the zucchini, spacing them evenly in the pan and pressing lightly with a spatula so that the planks make contact with the pan. Sprinkle the tops with salt and pepper, and cook for about 3 minutes, until the zucchini is nicely charred on the bottom. Lower the heat to medium, flip the zucchini, and season with salt and pepper again. Cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, until the bottom is charred. ",
    "Turn the heat to low and add the butter, garlic and rosemary. Carefully tilt the pan, letting the garlic and rosemary cook in the butter for 30 seconds to 1 minute, until the butter has begun to brown. Spoon the butter over the zucchini, and cook for another minute, flipping them a few times to coat both sides with the butter. ",
    "Transfer the zucchini to a serving platter, along with the garlic and rosemary, and spoon any butter that’s left in the pan on top. Top with coarse sea salt, lemon zest and red-pepper flakes, and serve hot. "
