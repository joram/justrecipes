  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 375 degrees. Put scrubbed beets in a small roasting pan filled with an inch of water. Cover tightly and bake until beets are tender when probed with a paring knife or skewer, about 1 hour. (Cook beets ahead and reheat if you wish.)",
    "When beets are ready, place them on a platter, unpeeled, and split them top to bottom with a paring knife. Season cut sides with salt and pepper. Top each beet half with a little butter and a generous spoonful of crème fraîche. Sprinkle with chives and dill, and cilantro (if using). Serve piping hot."
