  "instructions": [
    "Brew the tea: In a wide-mouthed kettle or small pot, bring 3 cups of water to a boil. Turn off the heat and add the tea bags; steep for 15 minutes. Remove the tea bags, pressing them against the side of the kettle to squeeze out any additional tea. Cool completely. The tea can be made 5 days ahead and stored in an airtight container in the fridge.",
    "Make the syrup: In a small saucepan, bring black sugar and 1/2 cup water to a boil over high heat. Once boiling, lower heat to medium and whisk, making sure the sugar has fully dissolved. Simmer for 5 minutes, then transfer to a heat-safe measuring cup or bowl and cool completely at room temperature (do not refrigerate); you should have about 3/4 cup. As it cools, the syrup will continue to thicken to the consistency of a spoonable molasses; it will be thinned by the tapioca pearls in the next step.",
    "Prepare the tapioca pearls: Cook and drain the tapioca pearls according to package directions. Once drained, place in a small bowl and stir in 1/2 cup of the black sugar syrup, tossing to make sure each pearl is coated. Let the pearls sit in the syrup at room temperature for at least 30 minutes but no more than 6 hours. Do not refrigerate the pearls; this will make them hard, and they will lose their chewy texture.",
    "Make the bubble tea: Take a tall, large drinking glass and tilt it slightly. Drizzle 1 tablespoon of the black sugar syrup around the rim, rotating the glass, so it drips along the inside and creates long streaks. Repeat with the second glass. Divide the pearls with syrup between the two glasses, followed by the tea and milk, and fill with ice. Stir to combine. Insert a boba straw and taste, adding more syrup if you prefer a sweeter drink."
