  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees and butter a 9-inch springform pan or a 10-inch tart pan with a removable bottom. Line with parchment and lightly butter the parchment. Sift the flour, baking powder, and salt into a bowl.\t",
    "Place the butter in a stand mixer and beat at medium speed until fluffy, about 1 minute. Add the olive oil and beat at medium speed for 1 minute, until the mixture is smooth. Scrape down the bowl and beater. Add the sugar and beat at medium speed for 1 minute. Beat in the eggs one at a time, scraping the bowl and beaters between each addition. Add the vanilla and almond extract and beat for 2 minutes at medium speed, until the mixture is very light. ",
    "Turn the speed to low and slowly add the flour. Beat just until incorporated. ",
    "Scrape the batter into the pan and spread it out evenly using an offset spatula. Arrange the plums on top in concentric circles, pressing them down into the batter. ",
    "Bake the cake for about 40 to 45 minutes, until the edges of the plums are beginning to color and a tester comes out clean when inserted into the center of the cake. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle with the turbinado sugar. Let the cake cool for 10 minutes on a rack before releasing the sides of the springform or tart pan. Then let it cool completely before slicing."
