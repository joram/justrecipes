    "Put the tequila and bay leaves into a blender and blend at a high speed until you can’t see any big chunks of bay leaf. Strain into a jar and cover. Allow to settle overnight. The next day, carefully pour the clarified tequila into another jar and discard the settled bay leaves. (You will lose about 5 percent of the tequila with the leaves.)",
    "In a mixing glass three-quarters full of ice, pour 3/4 ounce of the infused tequila. (Save the remainder for future drinks.) Add the Pimm’s, orange juice and lime juice and shake until chilled, about 30 seconds. Strain into a rocks glass filled with ice. Top with club soda and the orange twist."
