  "instructions": [
    "To grill the corn: Heat gas grill, or prepare a bed of hot coals, then heat and clean grates. To boil the corn: Set a large pot of water over high heat. Cover and bring to a boil.",
    "In the meantime, pound minced chiles into a fine paste in a mortar. Remove half the pounded chiles, and reserve. Add 2 tablespoons green coriander seeds to the mortar, and lightly pound until they break up and release a heavenly aroma, then stir in butter, garlic, ginger, fish sauce, flaky salt and cilantro. Taste and adjust for salt, and add reserved chiles as needed. Butter should be very fragrant, highly seasoned, savory, spicy and pungent.",
    "To grill corn: Cook over high heat or hot coals until just charred on all sides, about 8 minutes. To boil: Season boiling water generously with fine sea salt, and boil corn until just cooked, about 3 minutes.",
    "Slather butter over hot corn, sprinkle with remaining coriander seeds and flowers, if using, and serve with lime wedges.",
    "Refrigerate any remaining butter for up to 5 days. Serve with grilled fish, shellfish, chicken or vegetables."
