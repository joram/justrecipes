  "instructions": [
    "Heat the broiler with a rack 6 inches from the heat source. Trim the zucchini tips then quarter each zucchini lengthwise. Cut out and discard the seeded, center strip of each spear as best you can.",
    "On a sheet pan, toss the zucchini and tomatoes with the olive oil, soy sauce, cumin and red-pepper flakes. Arrange the zucchini skin-side down.",
    "Broil until the zucchini is darkened in spots and tomatoes are starting to break down, 3 to 4 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler. (If you find that one side is darkening faster than the other, then rotate your pan halfway for more even cooking.)",
    "Remove from the oven, turn the zucchini and tomato pieces over. Tuck the feta chunks in the empty spaces in between. Return under the broiler until most of the feta is lightly golden on the top, the zucchini easily pierced with a fork and most of the tomatoes have broken down, 3 to 4 minutes. Add the bread to another sheet pan on a lower rack to warm up, if desired.",
    "Turn some of the zucchini pieces over, if youâ€™d like. Top with the herbs, if using, and serve with bread and a final drizzle of olive oil, if desired."
