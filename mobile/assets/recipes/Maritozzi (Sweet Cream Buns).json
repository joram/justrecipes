  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, combine the warm milk, yeast and 1/2 cup/65 grams flour. Stir with a wooden spoon to form a wet dough. Cover the bowl with a clean towel and allow it to sit until doubled in size, 15 to 20 minutes. Pre-fermenting the dough like this gives the doughnuts a more complex, tangy flavor.",
    "Make the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine the eggs and buttermilk. Add the sugar, salt, nutmeg, pre-ferment and remaining 3 cups/388 grams flour. Knead on the lowest speed until it comes together in a smooth and elastic dough, about 5 minutes. Scrape the bowl and dough hook.",
    "Cut the butter into large chunks and add all at once. Incorporate by kneading the dough on speed 2 until the butter is folded in and the dough is again smooth and elastic, 5 to 6 minutes. Scrape down the bowl and fold the dough over to form a loose sphere. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate for the dough to rise slowly and chill completely, 4 to 12 hours.",
    "Line a baking sheet with parchment paper and dust lightly with flour. Place the dough ball on a lightly floured work surface and dust the top with some flour. Use a bench scraper or a knife to portion the dough into 10 even (90-gram) pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheet. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let rise until the chill is off and the dough feels light and airy, 45 to 50 minutes.",
    "Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Make an egg wash by combining the remaining egg with 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl. Brush the tops of the balls generously with the egg wash.",
    "Place the baking sheet on the middle rack of the oven and bake the rolls until light golden brown, 9 to 10 minutes. Reduce the oven temperature to 350 degrees. Rotate the baking sheet and bake for an additional 6 to 8 minutes until the rolls are deep golden brown and sound hollow when lightly tapped. Remove from the oven and transfer rolls to a wire rack to cool completely.",
    "Use a whisk or a hand mixer to combine the heavy cream and remaining 1 or 2 tablespoons sugar in a large bowl. Whip vigorously until medium firm peaks form when whisk is lifted.",
    "Use a sharp knife to slice down through the top to the center of a cooled roll. Tilt the knife and slice at a 30-degree angle to meet the original cut in the middle of the roll. Pop out the V-shaped piece from the roll (and save as a cook’s snack). Repeat the cutting for the remaining rolls.",
    "Fill each roll with a tablespoon of jam. Spoon in the whipped topping to cover the jam, filling the rolls one at a time. Use a spatula or back of a table knife to smooth the top of the cream so it’s flush with the sides of the roll. Wipe the edges if necessary with a clean towel. Dust with confectioners’ sugar if you’d like. Serve immediately."
