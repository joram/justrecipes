  "instructions": [
    "Place a flat wire rack on top of a large rimmed baking sheet. Place the turkey on top of the rack.",
    "Pat turkey dry with paper towels. Rub turkey all over with 3 to 4 tablespoons of salt (½ teaspoon salt per pound). Refrigerate uncovered overnight or for up to 3 days.",
    "Remove turkey from the refrigerator 1 hour before roasting and allow to come to room temperature.",
    "Meanwhile, place oven rack toward the bottom third of the oven and heat oven to 450 degrees.",
    "Using about half the herbs, tuck some sprigs under the turkey. Drizzle turkey lightly with oil (you can use a pastry brush or your hands to help spread it evenly if you like). Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, 40 to 55 minutes. If the breast looks like it’s getting too brown before the legs are done, cover it with foil.",
    "Remove turkey from the oven and let it cool completely. Remove herbs and cover with foil or plastic and refrigerate for up to 3 days.",
    "To reheat, remove turkey from the refrigerator 1 to 2 hours (but no longer) before roasting to allow it to come to room temperature.",
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Tuck more herbs around the turkey.",
    "Roast until an instant-read thermometer inserted in the thickest part of the thigh reads 165 degrees, 45 to 60 minutes.",
    "Let turkey rest for 15 minutes before <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=eUv1tq91NMY\">carving</a>."
