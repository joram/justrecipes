  "instructions": [
    "If grilling, heat the grill. If griddling, heat your griddle or pan to medium.",
    "Using a fork, mash strawberries with 1 tablespoon sugar until saucy with fine chunks.",
    "On a cutting board, open buns, leaving them connected on one edge. Brush the cut, flat surfaces with the melted butter and sprinkle lightly with sugar.",
    "Cook buns, buttered side up, until lightly toasted underneath, 1 to 2 minutes. Flip and toast the buttered sides until golden and the sugar caramelizes, imparting a nice sheen, 2 to 3 minutes. (You may need to rotate the buns to ensure even coloring and adjust heat lower, or move to a cooler spot if using a grill.) Transfer to a cutting board and let cool before assembling.",
    "Drizzle open buns with a little Amaro, if using. Top each bottom half with a spoonful of strawberry mash, followed by a single scoop of ice cream, then another spoonful of strawberry mash. Close up sandwiches and serve immediately."
