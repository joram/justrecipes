    "Wash the herbs and greens. Fill a large bowl or clean sink with cold water, and add the leaves. Swish them around to loosen dirt, then gently lift out and dry in a salad spinner or on clean kitchen towels. (You can do this up to a day ahead, refrigerating the dry leaves in sealed plastic bags or containers with a paper towel to absorb excess water.)",
    "When ready to serve, whisk together the salt, pepper, red-pepper flakes, lime juice and olive oil in a small bowl, then check the seasonings. Put the leaves in a large bowl, drizzle the dressing over them and toss gently to coat. Serve immediately."
