  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Fill a large pot with water and bring to a boil over high heat.",
    "Fill a large bowl with water. Trim and discard the ends of the cassava. Peel off the brown skin on the cassava with a sharp peeler or paring knife. Cut the cassava crosswise into thirds and slice each piece lengthwise into ½-inch-wide pieces. Cut each slice into ½-inch sticks and transfer to the bowl of water as you go to avoid discoloration. ",
    "Once the water in the pot is boiling, season it with 2 tablespoons of salt. Drop the cassava sticks carefully into the pot. Cook until the cassava is just beginning to soften and the surface becomes translucent, 45 to 90 seconds. Using a slotted spoon or sieve, transfer the cassava to a baking sheet. Pat the pieces dry with a clean towel and allow to cool slightly, about 10 minutes. ",
    "Gently toss the cassava sticks with 4 tablespoons oil on the baking sheet. Roast for 15 minutes, until just beginning to brown on the bottoms. Remove from the oven and use a spatula to toss the cassava with the remaining 2 tablespoons oil. Spread the sticks out again, flipping the pieces so the browned sides are up. Sprinkle lightly with salt and return to the oven. Roast until the cassava is golden and crisp, 10 to15 minutes. Serve the fries immediately while still hot."
