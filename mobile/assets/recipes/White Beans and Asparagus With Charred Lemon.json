    "Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat until shimmering. Add the lemon wedges, peel-side down, and cook for 1 or 2 minutes to release their oils. Flip onto cut sides and cook until the flesh is browned and charred in spots, 3 to 6 minutes. Flip onto the other cut sides and repeat. ",
    "Remove the lemon wedges, pour in the coconut milk and scrape to release all the charred bits stuck to the skillet. Stir in the beans and asparagus, season well with salt, and simmer until the asparagus is crisp-tender, 5 to 8 minutes. At first, the mixture might look thick, but there’s no need to add more liquid; the asparagus will release liquid as it cooks. ",
    "Remove from heat and squeeze in the lemon. Season to taste with salt and serve topped with herbs."
