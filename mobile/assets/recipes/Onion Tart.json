  "instructions": [
    "To make the pastry, process the flour, butter and water together in a food processor for a few minutes until a rough dough forms. Remove, wrap in plastic wrap and refrigerate for 30 minutes.",
    "Preheat the oven to 180°C (350°F/Gas 4).",
    "Roll the dough out on a floured bench and gently press into the tin. Trim the pastry to fit and reserve the left-over pastry to patch any cracks.",
    "To blind-bake the tart, line the pastry shell with foil and fill with baking weights or uncooked rice or beans. Bake until cooked, about 20 minutes. Remove the foil and weights and bake for an additional 15–20 minutes until lightly golden. If there are any cracks, patch with the left- over pastry.",
    "While the tart shell is baking, prepare the filling.",
    "In a large frying pan over low to medium heat, sauté the onion in the oil until very soft and light brown. This may take up to an hour. Set aside to cool slightly. Beat the egg yolks with the cream. Add the nutmeg and season well with salt and pepper. Stir the onion through the cream mixture.",
    "Carefully fill the pastry shell with the filling, place in the oven and bake for 40–45 minutes, or until the filling is set. Serve warm or at room temperature."
