    "In a cocktail shaker, combine the rye, lemon juice and simple syrup. If using egg white, add to the shaker, cover and shake for 10 seconds to combine. If not using egg white, or after shaking the egg white, add ice, cover and shake vigorously until the outside of the shaker is chilled, 10 to 15 seconds. If using egg white, strain into a chilled coupe. If not, strain over fresh ice into a rocks or old-fashioned glass. Serve with an orange slice and maraschino cherry, if desired."
