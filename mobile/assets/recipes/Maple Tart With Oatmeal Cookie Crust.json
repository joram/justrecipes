  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. In bowl of a food processor, combine oats, flour, brown sugar and salt, and pulse until oats are coarsely chopped. Add butter and pulse until evenly moistened.",
    "Transfer mixture into a 9-inch fluted tart pan with a removable bottom. Press crumbs evenly into bottom and up sides of the pan. Set pan on a rimmed baking sheet and bake until crust is fragrant, set and edges are golden brown, 18 to 20 minutes. Set on a rack to cool completely.",
    "In a medium saucepan, bring maple syrup to a simmer over medium heat. Cook maple syrup until it has reduced to 1/2 cup/120 milliliters, about 8 minutes. Set aside.",
    "Set a fine mesh sieve over a medium bowl. In a separate medium bowl or a 4-cup glass measuring cup, whisk together milk, cream and egg yolks. Add cornstarch to a medium saucepan. Gradually whisk in milk mixture until smooth. Add maple syrup and whisk to combine. Cook mixture over medium heat, whisking constantly, until it has thickened and just come up to a low boil, about 6 to 7 minutes. Continue to cook, stirring constantly, for another minute. Pour custard through sieve, using whisk to scrape it through. Discard any solids. Whisk in butter until fully combined with no solid bits remaining. Transfer mixture to prepared crust. Let cool slightly, then cover with plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 4 hours.",
    "Beat heavy cream and confectioners’ sugar until stiff peaks form. Gently fold in cinnamon and nutmeg until evenly distributed.",
    "Before slicing, remove pan rim from tart by carefully setting tart on top of a 28-ounce can (or something roughly the same size) and transfer tart to a serving platter. To serve, top slices with whipped cream."
