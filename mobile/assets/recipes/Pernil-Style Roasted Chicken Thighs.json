    "Heat oven to 425 degrees. In a small bowl, combine oil, orange juice, lime juice, garlic, oregano and granulated onion. Season with salt and pepper; mix well.",
    "On a large rimmed baking sheet, combine chicken and chopped onion and season generously with salt and pepper. Add the citrus-herb oil and toss to evenly coat, massaging the oil into the flesh side of the chicken. Arrange onions and chicken, skin side up, in a single layer and roast until golden and crispy, about 40 minutes.",
    "Transfer chicken and onions to a cutting board and let rest until cool enough to handle, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour off pan juices from baking sheet, scraping off any caramelized browned bits into a small bowl, and degrease, spooning off any excess oil from the top.",
    "Discard bones and coarsely chop chicken. Divide chicken and onions among 4 plates and spoon reserved pan sauce on top. Garnish with cilantro and serve with rice or tortillas, if desired, plus lime wedges and hot sauce, if using."
