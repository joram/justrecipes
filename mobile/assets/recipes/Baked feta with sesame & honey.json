  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 200C/180C fan/gas 6, or if using an air-fryer, heat to 180C for 3 mins. Put the sesame seeds in a shallow dish and brush the block of feta all over with the honey. Carefully press the honey-coated feta into the sesame seeds, turning so that itâ€™s well crusted with seeds.",
    "Put the feta in a baking dish (it should fit snugly), then sprinkle over the oregano and a pinch of sea salt. Drizzle with some olive oil. Bake in the oven for 15-20 mins, or cook in the air-fryer for 15 mins until the feta is soft, then drizzle with a little extra honey and serve with the pitta breads on the side."
