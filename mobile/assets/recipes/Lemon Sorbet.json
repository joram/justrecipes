    "In a medium, nonreactive saucepan, mix 1/2 cup (125 ml) of the water and the sugar. Grate the zest of the 2 lemons directly into the saucepan. Heat, stirring frequently, until the sugar is completely dissolved. Remove from the heat and add the remaining 2 cups (500 ml) water, then chill thoroughly in the refrigerator.",
    "Stir the lemon juice into the sugar syrup, then freeze the mixture in your ice cream maker according to the manufacturerâ€™s instructions.",
    "Freshly made Raspberry Granita (page 157) makes a lively partner and stands up well to the puckery lemon flavor."
