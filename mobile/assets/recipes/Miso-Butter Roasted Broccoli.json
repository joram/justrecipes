  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 425 degrees.",
    "Add the broccoli to a large sheet pan, along with any tiny stray pieces from the cutting board (they will get crunchy and browned). Drizzle with the olive oil, season with 1/4 teaspoon salt and toss to coat. Spread out the broccoli and roast until the underside is charred and the thickest stalks are easily pierced with a fork, about 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, in a small bowl, use a fork to mash the butter and miso together. (The mixture doesnâ€™t need to be perfectly uniform.) Add the mixture to the roasted broccoli, then squeeze half the lime juice over it and stir it all together, scraping up any brown bits on the bottom of the sheet pan. Season as needed with salt and the remaining lime juice. Serve warm or at room temperature."
