    "In a large bowl, toss the peppers with the oil. Heat a large (12-inch) cast-iron skillet over high until a drop of water smokes on the surface, 2 to 3 minutes. (You may want to turn on your vent, too.)",
    "Add the peppers in a single layer and cook, without touching, until blistered underneath, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip and cook until blistered in spots, puffed, and tender, another 1 to 2 minutes. Season with flaky salt and serve right away."
