  "instructions": [
    "Rinse the beans in hot water until they are white. Place them in a stockpot, add the water, and bring to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer for 3 hours. Meanwhile, simmer the ham hocks in a large pot of water for 3 hours. Heat the butter in a small skillet over medium heat. Sauté the onion until lightly browned. Add the onion to the pot of beans. Remove two cups of the bean mixture, purée in a blender, and return to the soup. Remove the ham hocks, and break down slightly with a knife. Add to soup mixture. Just before serving, season the soup with salt and pepper to taste."
