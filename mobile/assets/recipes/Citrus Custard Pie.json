  "instructions": [
    "On a lightly floured surface and using a lightly floured rolling pin, roll out a disk of dough into a circle about ¼-inch thick. Starting at one end, gently roll up the dough onto the rolling pin. Unfurl the dough over a 9-inch pie plate, preferably ceramic, and press it in lightly, making sure it’s lining the plate.",
    "Trim so that there’s about ½ inch of excess dough hanging over the edge of the pie plate. (If the dough feels warm, refrigerate it for 15 minutes.) Tuck the excess dough under itself so it is flush with the edge of the pie plate; leave the pie like this for a straight-edge finish, or crimp as desired. Dock the base and sides all over with a fork and refrigerate at least 30 minutes, and up to 2 hours.",
    "Place a rack on the bottom shelf of the oven, and place a baking stone, if you have one, on the rack. Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Use a small brush to evenly paint egg wash on the edge of the crust. Cut a square of parchment paper and use it to line the crust. Fill with pie weights (or dried beans) up to the top edge. Place the plate on a baking sheet lined with parchment or foil.",
    "Transfer the baking sheet to the oven, placing it directly on the baking stone if using. Bake crust until the outer edge is just starting to turn golden brown, 12 to 15 minutes. Remove the parchment and pie weights, and continue to bake until the base appears set, 2 to 4 minutes more. If the dough puffs up anywhere, you can puncture it with a fork. Cool the crust completely. Reduce the oven temperature to 375 degrees.",
    "Make the filling: Whisk the sugar, flour, ginger and salt in a medium bowl to combine. Add the milk, cream, extracts and zest and whisk well to combine. Transfer the pie plate to the prepared baking sheet. Pour the custard into the crust.",
    "Transfer the baking sheet back to the oven, placing it directly on the baking stone if using. Bake until the crust is evenly golden brown and the custard appears set around the outer edge, 40 to 45 minutes; the center of the pie may still be jiggly, like pumpkin pie or cheesecake, but it will firm up as it cools. Let cool completely at room temperature on a rack.",
    "Make the topping: Whip the cream and confectioners’ sugar to medium peaks. Scoop on top of the pie and spread in an even layer. Chill the pie in the refrigerator until ready to serve.",
    "Just before serving, peel each piece of fruit using a vegetable peeler. (Peeling in a spiral fashion around the fruit can help you get longer pieces of zest.) Use a sharp paring knife to trim away the rough edges, and then cut thin strips from the trimmed zest.",
    "Arrange the zest on top of the whipped cream, arranging the colors randomly and overlapping some pieces. The pie is best the day it is made; store leftovers in the refrigerator, wrapped tightly in plastic wrap."
