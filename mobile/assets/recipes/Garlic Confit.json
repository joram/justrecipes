    "Heat the oven to 275 degrees. Place the garlic in an oven-safe saucepan, skillet or baking dish that snuggly fits the cloves. Add enough olive oil to just cover the cloves. Bake until the cloves are golden and tender enough to easily smash with a fork, 1 to 1 1/2 hours. Let cool. ",
    "To store, transfer the cloves and oil to a clean, resealable container; if the cloves aren’t covered in oil, add more oil or try a different vessel. Because garlic confit is not very acidic, it will not keep on the counter; refrigerate up to 2 weeks and use a clean utensil to get what you need from the container."
