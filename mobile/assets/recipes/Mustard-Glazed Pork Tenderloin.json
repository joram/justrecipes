  "instructions": [
    "Pat the tenderloins dry with paper towels.",
    "Combine the remaining ingredients in a bowl and stir. Add pork tenderloins and turn to coat well with marinade. Marinate for 15 minutes or as long as overnight.",
    "Heat a large cast iron skillet or grill pan over medium-high heat until smoking. (Alternately, heat a charcoal or gas grill to high; bank coals or turn off burner on one side.) Season tenderloins with salt and pepper. Brush pan with olive oil and add tenderloins; reduce heat to medium-low. Cook, turning tenderloins every 3 to 4 minutes, until deeply caramelized on all sides and until desired internal temperature, about 20 to 25 minutes. (You can also broil the tenderloins in the oven â€” about 10 minutes on one side, then turn and cook about 5 minutes on the other.)",
    "Remove and lightly tent with foil; let rest about 10 minutes before cutting into 1/4- to 1/2-inch slices."
