  "instructions": [
    "In a small saucepan, combine the ginger, brown sugar, agave, star anise (if using) and 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil over medium-high heat, then lower the heat to around medium-low to briskly simmer for about 6 minutes, until fragrant and slightly thickened. (Coat the back of a metal spoon in the mixture, then drag your fingertip across it and a faint line should hold.) Turn off the heat and let sit for about 15 minutes, uncovered, to intensify flavor and thicken to a syrupy consistency. Pour through a mesh strainer set over a small bowl, press on the solids, then discard the solids. You should have a generous 1/2 cup ginger syrup. (The syrup keeps, refrigerated, for up to 5 days.)",
    "Before assembling, gather 6 small, microwave-safe bowls (ideally what you’d serve rice or ice cream in). Pour out any excess water from each tofu tub. Wield a broad, shallow metal serving spoon in a horizontal motion to scoop up large, very shallow pieces of the tofu, dividing them among the bowls. (It’s normal for the pieces to be irregular in shape and size.)",
    "Heat the bowls of tofu in the microwave, fitting as many in as possible and zapping in 20-second intervals until slightly warmed through. Liquid inevitably accumulates and you may pour it out to prevent it from diluting the syrup, or just allow its delicate tang to add to the overall flavor.",
    "Drizzle each serving with about 1 1/2 tablespoons of ginger syrup. Enjoy with a spoon."
