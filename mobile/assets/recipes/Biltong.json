    "Cut the meat into strips about 2 cm x 3 cm (3/4-inch x 1 1/4-inches). Roast the coriander seeds in a dry frying pan to bring out the flavour. Crush lightly with a pestle and mortar and mix with the salt and pepper. Sprinkle a little into a glass dish, top with a layer of meat strips, and season once more. Continue this way until meat and seasoning are used up.",
    "Refrigerate for a day, mixing every couple of hours so that the meat flavours evenly.",
    "Hang up to dry in a suitable spot (high in the garage rafters or behind the fridge where there is some movement of air). Straightened paper clips make handy fasteners!",
    "Drying time is about 5 days, depending on the weather, and whether you prefer your biltong crisp or slightly moist."
