    "Combine the oats and salt in a rice cooker. If using a model with a porridge setting and a cooking timer, stir in 3 1/2 cups cold water. If using a standard model, stir in 4 cups cold water.",
    "If your machine has a timer setting, set it to start cooking 2 hours before you want to eat your oatmeal. If it doesn’t have a timer, turn on the machine right before you go to bed. The machine should automatically go to a warming setting after it cooks the oatmeal, but check your machine to make sure.",
    "Gently stir the oatmeal, then divide among bowls or airtight containers to eat on the go and add the toppings of your choice."
