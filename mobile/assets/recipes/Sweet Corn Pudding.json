  "instructions": [
    "Combine the corn, milk, vanilla bean and seeds (if using) and salt in a medium saucepan. Set over medium-high heat and bring to a simmer. Immediately reduce the heat to low, partly cover with a lid and gently simmer, stirring occasionally so the milk doesn’t boil over, until the milk is fragrant with corn, about 30 minutes. Turn off the heat, remove the corn cobs and enjoy them later as a snack or with dinner, or store in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. You should have about 2 cups milk. If needed, add more milk.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and egg yolks. Add about 1/4 cup of the hot corn milk and whisk vigorously until smooth. Add this cornstarch mixture to the large pot of corn milk and bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking constantly until the pudding thickens, bubbles and coats the back of a spoon, 3 to 5 minutes.",
    "If using vanilla extract, stir it in now; if you used vanilla bean, remove it. If you have any lumps, pass the pudding mixture through a sieve set over a bowl, discarding any solids.",
    "Spoon the pudding into individual bowls or cups and enjoy warm, or you can place a sheet of parchment paper directly over the surface of the pudding (so a skin doesn’t form), cover and chill in the refrigerator to enjoy cold. The covered pudding will keep in the refrigerator for up to 3 days."
