  "instructions": [
    "Set 18 mini paper baking cups on a baking sheet. Melt 4 ounces of the chocolate either over a double boiler on the stove top or in short bursts in the microwave. Spoon 1 teaspoon of melted chocolate into each cup. Use an offset spatula or a small spoon to spread the chocolate slightly up the sides of each baking cup; make sure you have an even chocolate base at the bottom of each cup. Let cool at room temperature for about 15 to 20 minutes until mostly solid.",
    "Meanwhile, in a medium bowl, stir together peanut butter, confectionersâ€™ sugar, vanilla extract and salt. (Make sure the peanut butter is well-combined in the jar before you measure it.) Transfer the peanut butter mixture to a resealable plastic bag and seal it tightly.",
    "Cut one corner of the plastic bag and pipe 2 to 3 teaspoons of peanut butter mixture into the center of each cup. With a very lightly moistened finger, tamp down the peanut butter and make it flat and even, but leave a bit of space between the peanut butter and the edge of the paper cup (you should be able to see a ring of chocolate peeking from below the peanut butter).",
    "Melt the remaining 5 ounces of chocolate. Spoon 1 teaspoon of chocolate onto the top of each cup. Use an offset spatula or a small spoon to spread the chocolate evenly over the top and down the sides of the cup. Refrigerate until solid, about 30 minutes."
