  "instructions": [
    "Place cauliflower in a steamer basket set over a large, lidded pot (preferably wider than taller) of boiling water. Season with salt and pepper. Cover the pot and steam until cauliflower is totally tender, 8 to 10 minutes. (You can check the doneness by piercing it with a paring knife or fork.)",
    "Meanwhile, heat butter and hazelnuts in a small pot over medium heat. Cook, swirling the pot occasionally, until the butter has melted and begins to brown, 4 to 6 minutes. Using a wooden spoon or small whisk, stir the butter, making sure all the milk solids and hazelnuts are browning evenly. Add olive oil and continue to cook until both the butter and hazelnuts are deeply golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes more.",
    "Once the cauliflower is done, use a potato masher or large fork to gently crush it into bite-size pieces. Transfer cauliflower to a large serving platter or plate, and drizzle with 2 tablespoons lemon juice. Spoon hazelnut mixture over the cauliflower, and top with chives and flaky salt. Serve alongside lemon halves for squeezing."
