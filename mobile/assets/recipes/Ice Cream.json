    "When ice cream stored in the freezer starts to get icy or crystallized, you can often cure the problem by wrapping it very tightly in aluminum foil and returning it to the freezer for at least overnight.",
    "It is probably safer not to refreeze melted ice cream, and if you do, it tastes pretty dreadful anyway. What, then, do you do with it? Here are a few suggestions:",
    "Use it on fruit as a cream sauce, if the flavors seem compatible.",
    "Blend it with frozen fruit for an incredible milk shakeâ€“like drink. Or with fresh fruit for a darn fine smoothie.",
    "Pour it on chunks of toasted pound cake for a Backward Sundae (the ice cream is the topping).",
    "Or save it in the refrigerator until tomorrow morning and serve it with hot or cold cereal for a breakfast the kids will never forget."
