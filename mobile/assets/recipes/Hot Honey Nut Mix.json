  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 325 degrees and line a baking sheet with parchment paper. In a large bowl, combine the nuts and seeds.",
    "In a microwave-safe bowl, combine honey, butter, red-pepper flakes and ½ teaspoon salt. Microwave until the butter has melted, about 40 seconds. (Alternatively, you can melt the mixture in a small saucepan on the stove.)",
    "Pour the honey butter over the nuts and seeds, and stir until well coated. Dump onto the prepared baking sheet and spread in an even layer. You want the nuts spread out as much as possible.",
    "Bake, stirring occasionally, until the nuts are tacky and look and smell toasted, 20 to 25 minutes. Remove from the oven and immediately sprinkle over the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and all of the turbinado sugar. Let cool on the baking sheet, then transfer to a bowl and serve (or transfer to an airtight container, where they’ll keep for up to 4 days)."
