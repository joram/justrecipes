    "Put sugar, ginger, cardamom and 1 cup water in a nonreactive saucepan or skillet, and bring to a boil over medium-high heat. Turn heat to low and let syrup simmer for 5 minutes. Do not strain.",
    "Add rhubarb and stir to incorporate syrup, then continue to simmer for another 5 minutes or so. Set aside and let cool. (The rhubarb syrup can be made a day or two in advance, and becomes more intense.)",
    "Serve a large spoonful or wedge of ricotta on a small plate. Spoon at least 2 tablespoons of rhubarb sauce over the cheese. Garnish with pine nuts or pistachio, if using."
