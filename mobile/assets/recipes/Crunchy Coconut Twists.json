  "instructions": [
    "In a medium mixing bowl, combine sugar and shredded coconut. In a small mixing bowl, whisk together egg, heavy cream and salt to make an egg wash and set aside. ",
    "Place a sheet of parchment paper (about 12 by 16 inches) on a clean work surface. Unfold dough and roll the chilled puff pastry dough to about ⅛ inch thick (about an 11-by-15-inch rectangle). Generously brush egg wash over the top of the pastry. Sprinkle half of the coconut-sugar mixture in an even layer all over the egg-washed surface. Using a rolling pin, gently press coconut-sugar mixture into dough. Gently slide the pastry (still on the parchment paper) onto a cookie sheet. Cover lightly with another sheet of parchment and refrigerate until firm, 10 to 20 minutes.",
    "Once chilled, remove pastry from refrigerator. Using another cookie sheet or wire cooling rack, invert the pastry so the coconut-topped side is now on the bottom. Slide dough, still sandwiched between parchment, onto the countertop. Remove the top piece of parchment and set aside. Brush the puff pastry with the egg wash. Sprinkle evenly with remaining coconut-sugar mixture, and use a rolling pin to press it into the pastry dough. Carefully transfer pastry (still on the parchment) to a cookie sheet and cover again with the other sheet of parchment. Refrigerate until firm, 10 to 20 minutes.",
    "Remove pastry from the fridge, and remove the top layer of parchment. Using a sharp knife or pastry cutter, cut pastry into strips between ¼ and ½ inch (you can eyeball it). Return pan to the fridge to chill thoroughly, another 10 to 20 minutes. ",
    "Line 2 or 3 cookie sheets with parchment paper. (You can reuse the parchment paper you’ve been using for the dough.) Working one strip at a time, transfer to prepared sheets and twist the two ends in opposite directions several times to create a long twist. Press the ends onto the parchment paper so they stick and don’t unfurl. Space coconut twists about 1 inch apart. Sprinkle any coconut that fell off the strips back on top of them.",
    "Place in pans, uncovered, in the freezer for 10 to 15 minutes, or in the refrigerator for 20 to 30 minutes. The twists should be very firm and thoroughly chilled before baking. You can leave them in the fridge or freezer for up to 24 hours before baking, but if you leave them for more than an hour, cover them with plastic wrap so they don’t dry out.",
    "While the twists are chilling, heat oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Bake twists until toasted and golden brown all over, 15 to 22 minutes, rotating sheet pans halfway through. Cool on baking sheets for 5 minutes, then transfer to a wire rack to cool completely. Store for up to 1 week in an airtight container."
