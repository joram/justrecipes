  "instructions": [
    "Make the dumplings: In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, granulated sugar, baking powder, ginger and ½ teaspoon salt. Pour in the cream and stir with a spatula until combined.",
    "Prepare the blackberries: In a 10-inch cast-iron skillet (or other shallow 2-quart dish that is both stovetop- and oven-safe), whisk together the sugar, cornstarch and ¼ teaspoon salt. Whisk in ¼ cup plus 2 tablespoons/90 milliliters water, and then stir in the berries. Cook over medium heat until bubbling and then simmer for about 5 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Portion the dough into about 16 small dumplings (about 1 1/2 tablespoons/28 grams each) and decoratively top the fruit with them. Cover the skillet with a lid, if you have one (or a sheet of aluminum foil, or a heatproof plate wider than the cooking vessel), and cook the dumplings for 15 to 20 minutes, until a wooden skewer inserted in the center of one comes out clean and the tops are dry to the touch. Let sit for about 5 minutes to cool.",
    "To give the dumplings a little optional extra color and texture, prepare an egg wash: Whisk the egg and ¼ teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Brush the dumplings with the wash, sprinkle with turbinado sugar and broil for 1 to 3 minutes, watching closely, until the dumplings are nicely browned.",
    "Serve warm, with a drizzle of heavy cream or a scoop of ice cream, if desired. Fruit slump is best the day it is made, but will keep tightly wrapped in the refrigerator for up to 3 days. Reheat in a 300-degree oven for about 20 minutes."
