  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the berries: Trim berries and cut any large ones into 1/2-inch/1 centimeter pieces. Place berries in a ceramic bowl and add 3 to 4 tablespoons of sugar (depending on the sweetness of the fruit), the lemon juice and the dessert wine. Let them soak for as long as possible, at least 2 hours, so they release their juice, which you will need to moisten the lady fingers.",
    "Make the custard: Whisk together egg yolks and sugar in a metal bowl and set over a saucepan of barely simmering water. Continue whisking (by hand or with an electric mixer) until very warm to the touch but not quite boiling, about 5 minutes. The mixture should reach 160 degrees. Add dessert wine and whisk thoroughly for another minute. Remove bowl from heat, place in an ice bath and let cool completely. Whisk in mascarpone until smooth.",
    "Whip the cream in a separate bowl until it holds stiff peaks. Fold it gently into the mascarpone mixture.",
    "To assemble: Line the bottom of a deep 9-inch-square serving dish with half of the ladyfingers, making compact rows. Spread half the berries on top with about half of their juices. Make sure to drizzle the juice evenly over the ladyfingers so they will be soft but not soggy. Cover with half the mascarpone custard. Repeat process once more, for a two-layer tiramisù, then refrigerate at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.",
    "Sprinkle with brown sugar and decorate with edible flowers before serving. Cut into squares first, or use a spoon."
