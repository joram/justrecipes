  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the oven to 400°F (200°C).",
    "In a medium bowl, mix together the grapes, granulated sugar, and tapioca flour. Set aside.",
    "Lightly flour a work surface and roll out one disk of dough into a 14-inch (36-cm) circle. Drape it into a 9-inch (23-cm) pie plate. Trim away the excess dough, leaving a slight overhang and distribute the grape mixture in the dough-lined pie plate.",
    "Roll out the second dough disk into a 14-inch (36-cm) circle. Moisten the exposed edges of the dough in the pie plate with water, then drape the second dough circle over the top. Working all the way around the pie, tuck the upper dough edges under the lower dough edges and crimp to seal.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together the egg yolk and milk or cream. Brush the top crust generously with the egg wash and sprinkle with the coarse-crystal or granulated sugar. Pierce the top crust with a paring knife in 6 places.",
    "Bake until the top crust is browned and the filling juices are thick and bubbling, 50 to 60 minutes. If the crust is browning too quickly, loosely drape a sheet of aluminum foil over the top during baking.",
    "Let the pie cool for about 1 hour before serving.",
    "Don’t expect to cut neat wedges of this pie. Vanilla Ice Cream (page 143) or whipped cream (page 239) are lovely accompaniments.",
    "If you come across seedless Concord-style grapes at greenmarkets, you can use them, but be sure to halve them anyway, which breaks the skin and helps them soften during baking.",
    "Tapioca flour is available at Asian markets or by mail order (see Resources, page 270). It makes a clear, glossy pie filling. Substitute an equal amount of cornstarch if tapioca flour is unavailable."
