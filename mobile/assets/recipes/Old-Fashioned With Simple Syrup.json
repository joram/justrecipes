  "instructions": [
    "In an old-fashioned glass, combine ⅛ oz. simple syrup and 2 dashes Angostura bitters. Fill glass halfway with ice, then stir about a dozen times. Add enough ice to fill glass. Squeeze 1 half dollar-size slice orange peel, including pith, over glass to extract oils, add peel to glass, then add 2 oz. good-quality rye or bourbon. Stir just until drink is cold and the bite has softened, about a dozen times. Garnish with 1 maraschino cherry (preferably a Luxardo cherry). \n\nEditor’s note: This old-fashioned recipe first appeared on Epicurious in August 2006.
