    "In a medium bowl, whisk flour and salt together. In a separate bowl, use an electric mixer to beat the butter and sugar until well combined and fluffy, about 3 minutes. Add egg and vanilla and beat until just combined. Reduce speed to low and gradually blend in the flour mixture; mix until just combined.",
    "Form dough into two equal-sized balls and flatten into discs. Wrap both in plastic and chill at least 1 hour.",
    "Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Prepare a well-floured surface and a well-floured rolling pin to help keep the dough from sticking. Working with one disc at a time, roll dough to 1/4 inch thick. Cut out as many cookies as possible with cookie cutters (if dough becomes too soft, chill until firm). Arrange cookies 1 1/2 inches apart on two ungreased baking sheets and chill 15 minutes. Gather scraps, form into a small disc, and chill until firm.",
    "Bake cookies until golden brown at edges (rotating baking sheets and switching position on racks halfway through), 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to cooling racks to cool completely.",
    "Roll out the second disc of dough and scraps (reroll scraps only once) and bake on cooled baking sheets. Transfer to racks to cool completely. Decorate, if desired.",
    "Halve dough and form into two logs, 1 1/2 inches in diameter. Wrap logs in plastic and roll to form a more uniform round shape. Chill at least 2 hours.",
    "Position oven racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and preheat to 350°F. Slice cookies into 1/4-inch-thick rounds and arrange 1 1/2 inches apart on ungreased baking sheets. Bake cookies until golden brown at edges (rotating baking sheets and switching position on racks halfway through), 16 to 18 minutes. Transfer to cooling racks to cool completely. Decorate, if desired.",
    "Pistachio-Cranberry: After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup dried unsweetened cranberries and 3/4 cup chopped pistachios. Mix gently to incorporate.",
    "Lemon-Thyme: After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 1 tablespoon lemon zest and 1 tablespoon picked fresh thyme leaves. Mix gently to incorporate. After baked cookies have cooled, make a simple glaze, if desired: whisk together 1/4 cup confectioners' sugar and 1 to 2 tablespoons whole milk. Spoon a small amount onto the center of each cookie and top with additional lemon zest and thyme leaves.",
    "Chai-Spiced with Crystallized Ginger: When combining the dry ingredients, whisk in 1/2 teaspoon ground cardamom, 1/4 teaspoon ground clove, and 1/4 teaspoon ground ginger. After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup chopped crystallized ginger. Mix gently to incorporate. Sprinkle with sanding sugar or sugar in the raw, if desired, before baking.",
    "Carrot Cake: When combining the dry ingredients, whisk in 1 teaspoon ground cinnamon. After blending the flour mixture into the butter and sugar mixture, add 3/4 cup finely grated carrot and 3/4 cup chopped walnuts. Mix gently to incorporate.",
    "To make Carrot-Cake Sandwich Cookies: Follow the slice-and-bake method above to bake cookies. To make sandwich filling, use an electric mixer to beat 3/4 cup (1 1/2 sticks) unsalted butter on medium-high until smooth and fluffy. Add 8 ounces room temperature bar cream cheese and beat until well blended. Add 2 1/2 cups sifted confectioner's sugar, 1 teaspoon vanilla extract and mix on medium-low until well combined. Spread 2 to 3 teaspoons of filling on the flat side of a baked cookie, and then top with another cookie (domed side up) to form a sandwich. Repeat with the rest of the cookies.",
    "Mocha: Whisk 1/2 cup unsweetened cocoa powder and 2 tablespoons instant espresso powder into the dry ingredients. Follow the rest of the procedure as written above in the base recipe.",
    "To make Mocha-Caramel Sandwich Cookies: Follow the slice-and-bake method above to bake cookies. To assemble the sandwiches, spread homemade or store-bought dulce de leche caramel on the flat side of a baked cookie, then top with another cookie (domed side up) to form a sandwich. Repeat with the rest of the cookies."
