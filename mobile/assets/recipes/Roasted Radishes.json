    "Heat the oven to 400 degrees. If your radishes have fresh-looking greens, wash and dry them well. On a sheet pan, toss the radishes and greens with the oil (1 ½ tablespoons if using greens; 1 tablespoon if not). Season with salt and pepper. Arrange the radishes cut side down. (It’s OK if the greens are crowded.)",
    "Roast until the radishes are crisp-tender and translucent, the cut sides are golden in spots and the greens are crisp, 15 to 20 minutes. Drizzle with honey, if desired."
