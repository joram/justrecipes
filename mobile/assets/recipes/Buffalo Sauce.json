  "instructions": [
    "In a small saucepan over medium heat, melt the butter. Continue cooking, gently simmering the butter and stirring the pan occasionally with a wooden spoon, until the milk solids at the bottom of the pan start to brown, 3 to 5 minutes. It should smell nutty and almost like caramel or butterscotch.",
    "Remove from the heat and carefully transfer the very hot browned butter to a large, heatproof mixing bowl. Add the garlic, stirring until the garlic is fragrant, a few seconds. Add the hot sauce, brown sugar and vinegar. Season with salt and pepper. Whisk vigorously until emulsified. Taste and add more salt, pepper and brown sugar as desired.",
    "Use immediately or refrigerate in an airtight container for up to 1 week. This is an excellent dipping sauce for French fries, roasted cauliflower and any kind of chicken (grilled, roasted or fried), or slathered between two slices of toasted bread in a deli sandwich."
