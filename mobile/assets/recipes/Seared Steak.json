  "instructions": [
    "If time allows remove steaks from packaging, dry with paper towels, put on a plate and refrigerate a day or two. If not, wrap in paper towels and set on counter about 30 minutes. (If you're really in a hurry, just proceed.)",
    "Heat oven to 500 degrees (550 if possible), and set a rack in the lowest position, unless skillet can be placed directly on oven floor. Place a cast-iron skillet large enough to hold steaks without crowding over high heat, and heat until smoking. Sprinkle surface of pan with coarse salt, and put steaks in. Smoke will billow up; wearing a thick oven mitt, immediately transfer skillet to oven.",
    "Roast steaks, turning once, about 4 minutes a side for medium rare, or until browned and cooked to preferred doneness. Sprinkle with salt and pepper, and let rest 3 to 5 minutes. Slice steaks or cut each into two pieces, and serve."
