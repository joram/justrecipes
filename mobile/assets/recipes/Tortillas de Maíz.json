  "instructions": [
    "Set out a 1-gallon zip-top freezer bag, a plastic produce bag (or plastic wrap) and a tortilla press (or a smooth-bottomed 10-inch skillet or glass pie plate).",
    "If using fresh masa, knead the masa, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 2 tablespoons water with your hands in a large bowl until the mixture is soft and pliable but doesn't stick to your hands.",
    "If using masa harina, mix 2 cups masa harina, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1 1/3 cups water with your hands in a large bowl until the mixture is soft and pliable but doesn’t stick to your hands.",
    "Test the masa mixture: Scoop 1/4 cup masa mixture, roll into a ball and pat into 1/2-inch-thick patty. The edges of the patty should be completely smooth; this is the sign that the masa is properly hydrated. If the edges are cracked and craggy and the mixture is too dry or crumbly, the masa mixture needs more water. Return the patty to the bowl, add a tablespoon or two more water, one at a time, and mix to incorporate. When fully hydrated, knead for 3 minutes, cover the bowl with a damp clean towel and let sit for 20 minutes.",
    "Cut an 8-inch square of plastic from a zip-top bag and from a produce bag. (The masa will be easier to remove from the plastic if you use two pieces of differing thicknesses.) Divide the dough into 9 equal portions (about the size of Ping Pong balls) and roll into balls. Place on a sheet pan and keep covered with a damp kitchen towel while you press and cook the tortillas.",
    "Heat a comal, medium nonstick skillet, well-seasoned cast-iron skillet or a griddle over medium-high. Place the thicker plastic square on the bottom of the press. Working with one dough ball at a time, open the press and place one ball in the center of plastic and top with the thinner plastic. Gently press, holding steady, firm pressure for a few seconds, to flatten the dough to a 6 1/2-inch round. Open the press and remove the top plastic. Place the dough on your open palm so it is thicker plastic-side up, and peel off the plastic. (Alternatively, you can flatten the tortillas with a smooth-bottomed 10-inch skillet or glass pie plate. Place thicker plastic on a clean work surface and top with a masa ball and the thinner plastic and press down with the skillet or pie plate.)",
    "Cook the tortillas one at a time (unless you're using a large griddle), flipping every 30 seconds, until it just starts to brown in spots, about 90 seconds total. (If the tortillas are getting too dark in spots, lower the heat.) Stack and wrap the cooked tortillas in a clean kitchen towel to keep them warm. Repeat with the remaining dough balls and serve warm."
