    "Heat oven to 180C/160C fan/gas 4 and line 2 large baking trays with baking parchment.",
    "Measure the peanut butter and sugar into a bowl. Add Â¼ tsp fine table salt and mix well with a wooden spoon. Add the egg and mix again until the mixture forms a dough.",
    "Break off cherry tomato sized chunks of dough and place, well spaced apart, on the trays. Press the cookies down with the back of a fork to squash them a little. The cookies can now be frozen for 2 months, cook from frozen adding an extra min or 2 to the cooking time.",
