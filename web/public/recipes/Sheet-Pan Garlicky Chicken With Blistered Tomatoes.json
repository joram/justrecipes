  "instructions": [
    "Turn on the broiler and place a rack 6 inches from the heat source. In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, the juice of 1/2 lemon and the oregano; season to taste with salt. Transfer half to a small serving bowl and set in the fridge until ready to serve. Stir the garlic into the remaining mixture in the large bowl. Season the chicken all over with salt, then add to the bowl; toss to coat.",
    "On a sheet pan, combine the tomatoes, onion and olive oil; season with salt. Push to one side of the pan. Add the chicken to the other side in a single layer, scraping off any excess marinade. (You can crowd the tomatoes and onion to make room for the chicken.) Broil until the chicken is charred on top, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on the strength of your broiler.",
    "Remove from the oven, use tongs to turn over the chicken, then tuck the lemon slices under and between the chicken pieces. Push the tomatoes and onion slices around so they cook evenly. Broil until the chicken is cooked through (cut through the biggest piece to check), the onion slices a deep purple color and the tomatoes blistered, 5 to 7 minutes more. When you return the chicken to the oven, place the pitas on another sheet pan on a lower rack to warm up.",
    "Sprinkle the chicken with some of the mint. Cut the remaining lemon half into wedges. Serve the chicken and roasted tomato mixture with the pitas, feta, lemon wedges, remaining mint leaves and reserved yogurt."
