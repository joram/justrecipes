    "In a medium saucepan, whisk the brown sugar, cocoa powder and salt together until no lumps remain. Slowly stream in the cream while whisking constantly. Bring to a simmer over medium heat, whisking occasionally, until the mixture comes to a simmer and the sugar is completely melted, about 3 minutes.",
    "Remove from the heat, then whisk in the chopped chocolate until smooth. Add the peanut butter and whisk until smooth. Let cool slightly before topping your sundae. (The peanut butter fudge sauce will keep in the refrigerator up to 1 week stored in an airtight container. To serve, reheat it gently in the microwave or in a saucepan over low heat.)",
    "When ready to assemble a sundae, spoon a little bit of fudge into the bottom of a serving bowl or glass; top with ice cream, more warm fudge, whipped cream, chopped peanuts and a cherry."
