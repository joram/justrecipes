  "instructions": [
    "Slice off the kernels from each ear of corn (you should have about 4 cups). Then, with the flat edge of the knife or the edge of a small spoon, scrape each corn cob over a plate to collect the starchy “milk.” Discard the cobs.",
    "Heat the bacon in a large nonstick skillet over medium. Cook until crisp, stirring occasionally, 8 to 10 minutes. Transfer bacon to a plate lined with paper towels. Drain any fat into a small heatproof bowl, leaving about 2 tablespoons in the skillet. ",
    "Add the butter to the skillet to melt. Add shallots and sauté until tender, about 3 minutes.",
    "Increase the heat to medium-high. Add corn kernels to the skillet, along with the reserved starchy milk, the salt, paprika, pepper and sugar. Cook, stirring frequently, until corn is softened and lightly browned in spots, 5 to 7 minutes. ",
    "In a small bowl, combine 3/4 cup water with the cornstarch; stir until well combined to create a slurry. ",
    "Add the slurry to the corn mixture and cook, stirring constantly, until it’s smooth, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Stir in cooked bacon, red peppers and half the scallions to heat through, 1 to 2 minutes. Serve topped with remaining scallions."
