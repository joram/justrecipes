  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the slaw: Heat a charcoal or gas grill to medium-high (400 degrees). Place the poblanos on the hot grill over direct heat. Cook until the skin is charred, 12 to 15 minutes, turning once or twice. (If using a gas grill, keep the grill covered between flips.) Transfer to a cutting board and let cool. Remove the stems and seeds then finely chop. (The poblanos can be grilled ahead. Store in an airtight container in the refrigerator until ready to use, up to 1 day.)",
    "Make the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together the garlic, vinegar, celery seed and salt until combined, then gradually whisk in the olive oil until well blended. Whisk in the hot sauce, if using.",
    "Finish the slaw: In a large bowl, combine the cabbage, chopped poblanos, scallions, vinegar, sugar and salt; let stand for about 10 minutes. This process breaks down the cabbage and produces liquid. Feel free to pour off excess liquid before adding dressing. Add the dressing and toss until well combined and serve. The slaw can be made up to 2 days in advance. Transfer to an airtight container and refrigerate. Pour off excess liquid before serving. Your cabbage should be tender with a crunch."
