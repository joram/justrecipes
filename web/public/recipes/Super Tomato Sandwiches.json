    "Spread mayonnaise on both slices of the lightly toasted bread. Arrange tomato slices in a thick overlapping layer on top of the bottom slice. Sprinkle with salt, pepper  and basil if desired (do not salt if not eating right away).",
    "Place a layer of thin avocado slices on top of the tomatoes and top with lettuce leaves and the top slice of bread. Press down firmly and cut the sandwich in half. You can wrap and transport the sandwich, as the toasted bread will resist becoming soggy for a few hours."
