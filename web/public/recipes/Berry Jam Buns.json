    "Make the dough: Gently warm the buttermilk over low heat until it reaches 100 degrees.",
    "In a measuring cup, combine the buttermilk, sugar and yeast and let sit until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add 4 ¼ cups/544 grams of the flour and the salt to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook. Stir to combine then add the butter and toss it to coat in the flour. Add the eggs, buttermilk mixture and lemon zest; turn the mixer on low speed to combine.",
    "Turn the mixer up to medium and mix the dough for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough will be soft and billowy and will clear the sides of the bowl but stick to the bottom. Add more flour, 1 tablespoon at a time, if the dough seems very, very soft and is sticking to the sides of the bowl.",
    "Transfer the dough to a lightly buttered large bowl. Turn the dough to coat with butter, loosely cover the bowl with a clean, dry dish towel or a length of plastic wrap and let the dough rise in a warm spot until almost doubled in size, about 1 hour, then refrigerate the dough for at least 1 hour. (Refrigerating the dough makes it much easier to handle and roll. If preparing the dough in advance, you can refrigerate it for up to 24 hours and proceed with the recipe as written.)",
    "Butter a 9-by-13-inch baking pan.",
    "Assemble the rolls: Turn the chilled dough out onto a floured surface and pat or roll it into a rectangle about 12-by-16 inches and ¼-inch thick. Gently spread the preserves over the dough, leaving about 1 inch of dough on the long edge furthest from you. Sprinkle the raspberries evenly over the top of the jam (tear the berries in half if they are quite large), then zest the lemon over the top of the berries. From the long end closest to you, roll the dough into a tight log. With the seam side down, use a serrated knife or length of floss to cut the log into 12 even pieces.",
    "Place the rolls into the prepared pan, positioning them with the filling showing. Cover and let rise at room temperature until puffy and almost doubled in size, about 45 minutes.",
    "Finish the rolls: Heat oven to 350 degrees and bake until the rolls are cooked through and golden brown, 35 to 45 minutes.",
    "While the rolls are baking, make the icing: In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in a large bowl with an electric mixer, whisk the softened cream cheese, confectioners’ sugar, lemon juice and salt until smooth. The icing will be quite thick, but spreadable. Add a little bit more lemon juice if necessary.",
    "Let the rolls cool for about 5 minutes, then spread the icing over the top. Sprinkle with freeze-dried berries, if desired, and serve immediately."
