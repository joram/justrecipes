  "instructions": [
    "Place all of the ingredients in a blender, and blend until smooth. Chill in the refrigerator for 2 hours or overnight.",
    "If you are making granita, place a 9-by-11-inch baking dish in the freezer. Omit the corn syrup and reduce the sugar if desired.",
    "Place a container in the freezer. Using an immersion blender, blend the watermelon mixture for 30 seconds. If making sorbet, freeze in an ice cream maker following the manufacturerâ€™s directions. If making granita, scrape into the chilled baking dish and place back in the freezer. Set the timer for 30 minutes. Using a fork, scrape the ice crystals from the outside of the baking dish toward the center. Return to the freezer and set the timer for another 30 minutes. Continue to scrape the mixture with a fork every 30 minutes until you have a uniform frozen mixture. It should not be frozen solid. If you forget to scrape and the mixture does freeze like an ice cube, cut into chunks and use a food processor fitted with the steel blade to break it up. Transfer to a container and freeze. Allow to soften for 15 minutes in the refrigerator before serving."
