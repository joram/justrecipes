    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with parchment paper.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together the flour, salt, baking powder and baking soda.",
    "In a large bowl using an electric mixer, beat the butter until creamy, 1 to 3 minutes. Add the granulated sugar and brown sugar, then beat until fluffy, about 2 minutes. Beat in the egg until smooth. Beat in the vanilla extract until just combined.",
    "Reduce mixer to low speed and beat in the flour mixture. Use a rubber spatula to scrape down the sides of the bowl, making sure everything is incorporated. If not, beat it again for a few seconds. Beat in the regular (not mini) chocolate chips.",
    "Place dough on the prepared baking sheet. Using your hands or a rubber spatula, spread the dough in an even layer about 1/4 inch thick, almost to the edges of the pan (it won’t quite reach). Sprinkle generously with flaky sea salt. Bake until the edges turn golden brown, about 17 to 20 minutes. The center will still be quite soft, but the dough will firm up as it cools. Transfer the baking sheet to wire racks to cool slightly.",
    "Trim the ragged edges of the cookie to make a neat rectangle (this is the cook’s snack). Cut the cooled cookie in half so that you have two squares. Flip one square over so that the bottom is now facing up. Spread the softened ice cream over the flipped square, then place the second square on top of the ice cream, chip side up. Transfer to a parchment-lined plate and cover loosely with plastic wrap. Place in the freezer to harden, about 11/2 to 2 hours.",
    "Remove the plate from the freezer. Once the cookie is soft enough to cut (5 to 10 minutes), cut into 12 squares. A warm knife (run it under hot water) will help with this. If the ice cream starts to melt or spread, place the chipwiches back in the freezer to firm up.",
    "Pour the mini chocolate chips into a shallow bowl or plate and sprinkle chips with flaky sea salt. Press each side of the sandwiches into the chocolate chip-salt mixture. Refreeze for at least another 1 hour so the chips adhere. Remove from the freezer 5 to 10 minutes before serving."
