    "In a large bowl, whisk together the brown sugar, pineapple juice, beet juice, soy sauce and garlic until the sugar has completely dissolved. Add the sliced pork and massage it with the marinade until coated. Cover, refrigerate and let marinate for at least 24 hours and up to 2 days.Â ",
    "Take the pork out of the marinade, letting the excess drip off, and transfer the pork to a plate. In a nonstick pan on medium-low heat, add the oil. Place the pieces of pork in the pan while the pan is still cold, making sure not to overcrowd it. (You may need to cook in batches.) Cook on one side for about 2 minutes, then turn and cook on the other side for another 1 to 2 minutes, until the pork starts to develop a nice caramelized color. Continue to cook, turning frequently, until caramelized on both sides and the meat is fully cooked, 5 to 7 minutes total per batch. (If the pork seems to be browning too quickly, turn the heat down.)",
    "Transfer the cooked meat to a plate and repeat with the remaining pork. Serve hot, with fried rice, eggs and tomatoes."
