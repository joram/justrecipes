    "Set racks in the upper and lower thirds of the oven and heat to 400 degrees.",
    "Spread the tortilla chips in a single layer on two large sheet pans. Place a scant tablespoon of shredded cheese over each chip, pressing slightly to adhere. Top each chip with 1 or 2 slices pickled jalapeño. Sprinkle or spoon the pickled jalapeño brine all over the chips. Bake until cheese melts completely and begins to lightly brown at the edges, 5 to 7 minutes.",
    "Serve nachos immediately, directly on the hot baking sheets, or use a spatula to transfer them to a platter."
