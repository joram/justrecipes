    "Heat the oven to 425 degrees. Prepare the dressing: In a small bowl, whisk together 1/2 cup olive oil with the mustard, garlic, vinegar and cumin seeds. Season generously with salt and pepper.",
    "Prepare the cabbage: Halve the cabbage lengthwise through the core, then cut each half into 1-inch-thick wedges. (Make sure to continue cutting lengthwise through the core to keep the pieces intact.) You should have about 16 pieces.",
    "Add the cabbage wedges to a large (13-by-18-inch) baking sheet. Brush all the wedges with half the vinaigrette, then carefully turn and brush the other side with remaining vinaigrette. Arrange in an even layer, then season generously with salt and pepper. On a separate baking sheet, brush the red onion rounds with olive oil on both sides; season generously with salt and pepper. Add the onion rounds to the cabbage wedges, interspersing the red onion and cabbage and tucking some onion rounds partly underneath. Sprinkle the capers evenly on top.",
    "Prepare the chicken: In a small bowl, toss the coriander and cumin with 1 tablespoon salt and 1 1/2 teaspoons pepper. Place the chicken on the sheet pan where you oiled the onions and drizzle with olive oil all over, then rub the seasoning all over the chicken. Arrange the chicken pieces on top of the cabbage and onions, skin-side up.",
    "Transfer to the oven and roast until the chicken is cooked through and the cabbage is lightly browned in spots and tender, about 35 to 40 minutes. Top with parsley or dill and serve immediately, passing more mustard on the side."
