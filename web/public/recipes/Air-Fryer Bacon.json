    "Heat air fryer to 400 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer.",
    "If working with a smaller air fryer basket, cut bacon strips in half crosswise so the bacon can fit comfortably without any overhang. Arrange the bacon flat in a single layer.",
    "Cook until the bacon is browned and starts to ripple (or to desired doneness), about 8 minutes, flipping the bacon halfway through. The cook time may vary, depending on the thickness of your bacon and your desired crispiness. Cook the bacon for 1 to 2 more minutes, if using thicker bacon or if you like your bacon on the crispier side.",
    "Transfer the bacon to a paper towel-lined plate to drain, if needed."
