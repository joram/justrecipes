  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 375 degrees. In a 2- to 3-quart dish (such as a 10-inch skillet or a 9-by-13-inch dish), toss the peaches with 1/3 cup brown sugar, the lemon juice and 1/2 teaspoon salt.Â ",
    "In a medium bowl, use your hands to stir together the remaining 1/3 cup brown sugar and 1/2 teaspoon salt with the flour, granulated sugar and lemon zest. Add the almonds and oats, and stir to combine. Add the coconut oil and stir until the mixture holds together when squeezed in your hand.",
    "Stir the cornstarch into the peaches, then spread into an even layer. Clump some topping in your palm, then break off pieces ranging in size from a walnut to a hazelnut and scatter lightly on top of the peaches. Repeat with the remaining topping. Bake until the crumble is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling in the center, 40 to 45 minutes. If the crumble is browned before the fruit is bubbling, cover with foil. Let sit at least 15 minutes before serving."
