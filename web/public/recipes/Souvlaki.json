  "instructions": [
    "Set aside eight (10- to 12-inch) wood or metal skewers. (If using wooden skewers, soak them in water for at least 30 minutes before using. This will prevent the skewers from catching fire on the grill.)",
    "In a large bowl, combine the yogurt, olive oil, garlic, rosemary, oregano, cumin, 1 teaspoon salt and 1/2 teaspoon pepper. Zest the lemon over the bowl; halve the lemon and reserve for serving. Whisk until smooth.",
    "Pat the chicken dry with paper towels and cut into 1- to 1 1/2-inch cubes. (If you’re using thighs, the pieces may be thinner than 1 inch, so cut them a little bigger for folding later when skewering.) Add the chicken to the marinade and toss well. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours, or up to 1 day.   ",
    "Thread the chicken onto the skewers, separating the breasts and thighs if using both, and folding any thinner pieces in half so that all the pieces are similarly sized. You should have 6 to 8 skewers total. ",
    "If using a grill, lightly oil the grates. Set the grill to medium-high (400 degrees) or heat a grill pan slicked with olive oil on the stovetop over medium-high. Grill the skewers for 8 to 10 minutes with the lid closed, turning once halfway, until fully cooked. (Breast meat will cook more quickly than thighs.) If the chicken sticks to the grates, give the skewers another minute before turning. (An internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the chicken should read 165 degrees.)",
    "Transfer the skewers to a platter and squeeze the reserved lemon over them. Serve the chicken on the skewers, or remove the pieces and arrange them on a platter. Sprinkle with salt, pepper and parsley. Serve with toasted pita and tzatziki, as well as additional lemon wedges, if desired. "
