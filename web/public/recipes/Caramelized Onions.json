  "instructions": [
    "Melt the butter in a large (12-inch) skillet over medium-high. Once foaming, add the onions, season with salt and stir to combine. Cover and let steam, stirring once or twice, until softened and just beginning to brown, 3 to 6 minutes.",
    "Reduce heat to medium and remove the cover. Stir frequently until the onions are deep brown, 15 to 20 minutes. Every time you see browned bits on the skillet, add a couple tablespoons of water and scrape up the bits. Add the wine, if using, and stir until evaporated, then season to taste with salt."
