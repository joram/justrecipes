    "Bring a pot of water to boil, and salt it well. Cook the Chinese broccoli until tender, about 4 minutes. Scoop the greens out with a skimmer, and dry well. Keep the water boiling.",
    "Cook the noodles according to the package directions. As soon as theyâ€™re drained, return them to the empty pot, off heat, and dress them with 6 tablespoons of <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1019308-caramelized-scallion-sauce\">the caramelized-scallion sauce,</a> or to taste. Season with salt, if desired.",
    "Divide the noodles into bowls, and top with the Chinese broccoli, the chicken (or whatever protein you choose) and the eggs. Drizzle oyster sauce on the Chinese broccoli, and season the eggs with a few drops of soy sauce. Top with a few pinches of julienne ginger or pickles, and serve immediately."
