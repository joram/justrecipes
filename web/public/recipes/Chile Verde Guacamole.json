  "instructions": [
    "Place the Anaheim chile on a small baking sheet covered with aluminum foil. Roast it under the broiler, flipping a couple times, until the chile is wilted and its skin is completely charred and wrinkly, 9 to 12 minutes. (Alternatively, you can char the chile directly on a hot comal or a cast-iron pan set over medium heat, or on a grill set to high.)",
    "Place the charred Anaheim chile in a plastic bag and close it well. Let it steam and sweat for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "As the Anaheim chile steams, add the serrano chile, onion, cilantro and salt in a bowl or molcajete, and mash until combined. Add the avocado and continue to mix and mash until you form a chunky pur√©e.",
    "Once it is cool enough to handle, remove the Anaheim chile from the bag, slip off the charred skin, make a slit down the side and remove the seeds and stem. You could rinse the chile under a thin stream of water, to help remove the seeds, or rinse it off by dipping it into a bowl of water.",
    "Finely chop the Anaheim chile. Add it to the avocado mixture, and stir to combine. Season to taste with salt."
