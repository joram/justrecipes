  "instructions": [
    "If using whole wheat bread, lightly toast it. This will prevent sandwich from becoming soggy. If using a roll with a hard crust, there is no need to toast.",
    "In a bowl, mash goat cheese with a fork or spoon and stir in chopped herbs.",
    "Spread equal amounts of goat cheese on each slice of bread or on both halves of roll. Top the bottom half with roasted pepper and cover with other slice of bread or half of roll. Cut in half if using bread, or into quarters if using a ciabatta roll. Wrap each piece tightly in plastic if transporting. The sandwich keeps well for 2 days."
