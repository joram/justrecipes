  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs, butter and 1 1/2 teaspoons salt. Stir thoroughly to combine, then set aside.",
    "Add the cream cheese, sugar and remaining salt to a large bowl, if using a hand mixer, or to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with a whisk attachment. Beat on medium-high speed until the cream cheese has become fluffy and the sugar has started to dissolve, about 1 minute. Scrape down the sides of the bowl and add the heavy cream, vanilla extract and almond extract (if using). Beat on low speed to combine, then raise the speed to medium-high and beat until medium peaks form, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "In a glass or metal 9-by-13-inch pan, add half of the graham cracker mixture and press firmly into an even layer. Add half of the cream mixture on top and smooth into an even layer, making sure it fully covers the graham cracker crust. Add both cans of cherry pie filling and gently smooth into an even layer over the cream mixture. Top with a layer of the remaining cream then the remaining graham cracker mixture. Cover and chill overnight (or at least 4 hours).",
    "Scoop to serve, straight from the refrigerator, into bowls or plates. Cherry yum-yum will keep in the refrigerator for at least 5 days (if it lasts that long) — and tastes even better the day after it’s made."
