    "Line a sheet pan with parchment or foil. On the sheet pan, toss the sweet potatoes with oil and a generous pinch of salt. Arrange cut-sides down, place on the middle rack of the oven, and heat the oven to 425 degrees. ",
    "Roast, without flipping, until the cut sides are sticky and a knife inserted slides through easily, 30 to 45 minutes. Caramelization on the cut sides will vary depending on your oven and type of sweet potatoes: To brown further, warm a drizzle of oil in a skillet over medium heat; add the potatoes cut-sides down and sear until as browned as you’d like."
