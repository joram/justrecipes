    "In a small bowl, stir together the sugar, cinnamon and salt.",
    "Melt some butter in a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over medium-low; you’ll want enough to lightly coat the bottom of the skillet when melted. When bubbling, add as many bread slices as will fit. Swirl the bread around to absorb the butter, adding more butter if the pan is dry. Cook until light golden brown, 2 to 3 minutes, adjusting the heat as needed to avoid burning.",
    "Add another pat of butter, flip the bread and swirl to coat the other side in butter, gently pressing the bread to pick up any browned bits. Sprinkle the toasted tops edge to edge with a thin layer of the cinnamon sugar. Cook until the underside is golden brown, 1 to 2 minutes, adding more butter and adjusting temperature if the pan is dry or the toast is burning.",
    "Flip and cook until the sugar sizzles and starts to melt, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Transfer to a plate, sugar side up. (If any melted sugar sticks to the pan, gently swipe the bread over it to pick it up.) Sprinkle toasts with more cinnamon sugar. Wipe skillet and repeat with any remaining bread."
