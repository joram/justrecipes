    "Prepare the filling: Place the coconut, ground cardamom and sugar into a medium bowl; mix well and set aside.",
    "Prepare the pancakes: In a separate medium bowl, stir together the flour, milk, egg, sugar and salt to make a thin batter. If you desire colorful pancakes, split the batter into four bowls: One bowl can be left as the original color, then add 3/4 cup batter to each of three separate bowls to brighten with food coloring as you please. (Purple, green and pink are common options.) Stir each colored batter to combine.",
    "Heat a crepe pan or 8-inch nonstick skillet over medium. Grease the pan with some oil or butter to coat, wipe off excess.",
    "Pour about 1/3 cup of batter into the pan and tilt the pan in a circular motion to spread the batter evenly all around. The pancakes should be thin, like crepes. Cook until the edges are dry and only the middle appears slightly wet, about 2 minutes. (Cook time will vary, depending on the thickness of the batter in the pan.) Flip pancake over and cook for about 1 additional minute.",
    "As pancakes are done, transfer them to a plate. Continue making pancakes until the batter is done, adding additional oil or butter between pancakes and lowering the heat as necessary.",
    "Set a pancake on a flat surface, spotted side up if one side is darker than the other. Place about 1/4 cup of filling in the center of the pancake, arranged in a log. Fold the top flap down to cover the filling, then repeat with the bottom flap. Carefully transfer to a serving plate, flap side down. Repeat with remaining pancakes and filling and serve."
