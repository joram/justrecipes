  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the dough: In the bowl of a stand mixer, using the dough hook, combine 2 ¼ cups/580 milliliters water with the flour and mix on low speed until well blended. Cover (you can detach the dough hook but leave it in the bowl) and let sit for 25 minutes.",
    "In a small bowl, combine 2 ½ tablespoons/35 milliliters warm (not hot) water with yeast until well mixed; let sit for about a minute.",
    "Add the yeast mixture, sugar and salt to the flour mixture and mix with the dough hook on low speed until incorporated.",
    "With the mixer on low, slowly drizzle in 2 tablespoons/29 milliliters oil until incorporated; the oil may seem to just sit on the dough at first, but it will eventually blend in. Continue mixing on medium-high until well-mixed and a smooth dough that no longer sticks to the sides of the bowl forms, 5 to 8 minutes. The dough will be slightly tacky when lightly touched. Cover tightly and refrigerate for 24 hours to ferment. If possible, after the dough has chilled for 6 to 8 hours, using a dough scraper and damp hands, briefly scrape and fold the dough from around the edges of the bowl into the center (this will help to ensure the dough is a similar temperature throughout, which will lead to a better structure).",
    "At least 3 hours before you plan to bake, prepare the tomato sauce: Place the crushed tomatoes in a nonreactive container, just large enough to store them. Push the garlic through a garlic press (or finely grate them) directly onto the tomatoes. Add the salt and olive oil and mix thoroughly. Cover and refrigerate for 3 hours (or up to one week) before using.",
    "After the dough has fermented for 24 hours, continue preparing the dough: Lightly flour a clean work surface. Turn dough out onto the surface (a plastic dough scraper is helpful here to remove the dough from the bowl) and, with lightly floured hands, fold the edges in to form the dough into a rough rectangle, trying not to incorporate too much more flour into the dough. (It may be helpful to keep a small bowl of water nearby; dough will not stick to wet hands.)",
    "Spread ⅓ cup/80 milliliters oil in a 13-by-18-inch sheet pan and add the dough, seam side down. Drizzle a bit more oil (about 2 tablespoons/29 milliliters) all over the top of dough and cover with plastic wrap. Let sit at room temperature for 3 to 4 hours, until the dough has doubled or even tripled in size and is relaxed and easy to stretch; if not, cover and let sit until it is.",
    "Press and stretch dough with fingertips to the edges of the pan, lifting the dough as necessary to make sure there is oil underneath the dough all the way to the center. Pat the dough into an even layer, dimpling it with your fingertips all over.",
    "When ready to bake, heat oven to 425 degrees (see Tip). Add 3 cups of tomato sauce to dough, spreading evenly over the surface but leaving a ½-inch border of uncovered dough at the edges. Bake until the crust is starting to turn brown with some darker spots, about 25 minutes.",
    "Remove from oven and increase oven temperature to 450 degrees. Add up to 3 more cups of sauce, spreading evenly, and bake until crust is very well browned, 20 to 25 minutes more.",
    "Transfer the pie to a wire rack, then set the rack over the same sheet pan to catch any drips. Lightly sprinkle with oregano and drizzle with more olive oil while still warm (the pie should be glistening). Let cool 30 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a cutting board and, using a bread knife, cut into pieces. Serve at room temperature, drizzled with more olive oil."
