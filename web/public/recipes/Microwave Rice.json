    "Rinse the rice: Add the rice to a sieve and run water over it while swishing it around with your hands. Do this until the water below the sieve looks clear, a few minutes. Drain well. Alternatively, place the rice into a large bowl, add water to cover it, swish the rice around a few times with your hands and drain it out. Do this 3 to 4 times, until the water you drain runs clear. If the rice isn't thoroughly rinsed, it may clump.",
    "Transfer the rinsed rice to a large (2 1/2- to 3-quart) microwave-safe bowl and add 2 cups of room-temperature water. Microwave, uncovered, on full power for 15 to 25 minutes. If you have a powerful microwave (1000 to 1200 watts), start with 15 minutes. If you have a less powerful microwave (700 to 900 watts), start at around 20 minutes. The rice will be done when the grains are poking up like grass and are tender and the water is fully absorbed; the grains shouldn’t look wet or mushy. If the rice isn’t done, keep microwaving it in 1- to 2-minute increments. After the rice is cooked, let it rest, undisturbed, in the closed microwave for another 5 minutes, then fluff it with a fork or rice paddle. (Some condensation may collect in the interior of the microwave but can be easily wiped dry.)"
