  "instructions": [
    "Line up 3 (16-ounce) plastic bottles with lids on your countertop. ",
    "To a large mixing bowl or pitcher, add vodka, rum, schnapps, Everclear and fruit punch; whisk to combine. ",
    "Fill each bottle using a spouted measuring cup or funnel, leaving a bit of space at the top for the drinks to expand as they freeze. Cover the bottles with lids and shake the drinks to fully combine.",
    "Place drinks in the freezer until slushy, 8 hours and up to 24. (You can make them 24 hours in advance, but know that they’ll need to sit at room temperature for 15 minutes or so to defrost a bit. Make sure to give them a good shake before drinking; they’ll start out slushy but melt quickly.)"
