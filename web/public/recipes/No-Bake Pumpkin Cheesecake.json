  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: In a large bowl, combine the cookie crumbs, brown sugar and salt. Add the melted butter and stir to combine.",
    "Press the mixture very firmly and evenly into the bottom and about halfway up the sides of a 9-inch springform pan. Chill in the refrigerator while you prepare the filling.",
    "Prepare the filling: Add 1 cup/240 milliliters heavy cream to the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the whisk attachment or in a large bowl with an electric mixer and mix until the cream stands up straight but the very tip curls over when the whisk is lifted. Transfer the whipped cream to a medium bowl.",
    "Add the cream cheese, pumpkin purée, confectioners’ sugar, 1 tablespoon cinnamon, the ginger, nutmeg, allspice and a pinch salt to the bowl that you used to whip the cream and mix on medium, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl occasionally, until the mixture is smooth, 3 to 4 minutes.",
    "Using a spatula, fold the whipped cream into the cream cheese mixture by gently scooping from the bottom and folding over the top, turning the bowl as you go, until combined.",
    "Spoon the filling into the prepared crust, then smooth the top.",
    "Refrigerate the cheesecake until completely cool, at least 4 hours, or overnight.",
    "Just before serving, prepare the topping: Whisk the remaining 1 cup cream, 1 tablespoon confectioners’ sugar and 2 teaspoons cinnamon to soft peaks.",
    "Just before removing the outer ring of the springform pan, run a thin knife or offset spatula around the edge of the pan to help the crust release from the sides of the pan. Remove the ring and spread the cinnamon whipped cream over the chilled cheesecake.",
    "Slice with a warm, clean knife. This cheesecake keeps, covered, in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. (The filling may weep a bit as it sits.)"
