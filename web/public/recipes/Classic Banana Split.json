  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the walnuts: Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Spread walnut halves evenly on a baking sheet and bake for 8 to 12 minutes, or until nuts smell toasted and are slightly darker in color. Transfer to a rack to cool.",
    "In a medium bowl, whisk together maple syrup, honey and salt. Add nuts (itâ€™s OK if they are still hot) and stir to combine.",
    "Prepare the fudge: In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring the cream, sugar, honey, cocoa and salt to a simmer, whisking until the sugar dissolves and the mixture thickens slightly, about 5 minutes.",
    "Stir in the chocolate and let cook until the chocolate melts, about 2 minutes. Stir in butter and vanilla (or liquor). Let cool slightly. Serve warm, not piping hot. If the fudge sauce begins to separate, vigorously whisk in 1 tablespoon hot water. Fudge sauce can be made up to 2 weeks ahead and stored in the fridge. Gently reheat before serving.",
    "Line a banana split bowl or other bowl with the banana halves. Top with scoops of ice cream, hot fudge and walnut sauce. Cover with whipped cream. Top with a cherry, if you like. Serve immediately."
