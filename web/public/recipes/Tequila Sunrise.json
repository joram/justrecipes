  "instructions": [
    "Place a highball glass in the freezer to chill for 10 minutes. Once chilled, fill the glass with ice. Add the tequila and orange juice and stir to mix. Without tilting the glass, slowly add the grenadine from one side, so it settles at the bottom. Do not stir. (Alternatively, you can hold a small spoon inverted over the glass and slowly pour the grenadine over it.) Garnish with an orange slice and top with the cherry."
