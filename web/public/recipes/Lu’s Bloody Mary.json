  "instructions": [
    "Squeeze lemon and lime wedges into a shaker. Add all other ingredients except vodka, and stir. Taste the mix, and adjust the seasoning if needed. Put the mix in the fridge, and let it sit overnight.",
    "Pour vodka into the shaker. Add ice cubes, and shake.",
    "Fill an 8-ounce glass about halfway with ice, and strain the shaker contents over it.",
    "For garnish, I prefer a slice of seedless cucumber, also known as a hothouse or English cucumber, rather than celery. (This isn’t a deal breaker, though.) Cut a 1/2-inch-thick slice of cucumber on the bias. Cut a slit in the slice, and place on the rim of the glass. Spear the pitted green olive with a toothpick, and stick it through the rind of the lemon wedge. Place the wedge on the rim of the glass. Crack a little freshly ground pepper on top."
