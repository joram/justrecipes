    "In a medium shallow bowl, add the egg and soy sauce and whisk together until completely smooth. Add the scallions and a few turns of black pepper and whisk to combine.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the kimchi and grated cheese. (If you are using sliced cheese, tear it up.)",
    "Place the two slices of bread on a cutting board and top one with the kimchi and cheese mixture. Place the other slice of bread on top to create a sandwich.",
    "Dip one side of the sandwich into the egg mixture and leave for 30 seconds. Carefully flip the sandwich over (making sure the filling doesnâ€™t fall out) and soak the other side in the remaining egg mixture, leaving it while you prepare your skillet.",
    "Heat a medium nonstick skillet on medium for 1 to 2 minutes until it is hot. Add the butter and swirl to melt. Place the eggy sandwich into the pan, cover with a lid and cook for 2 minutes until it is golden. Flip the sandwich over to cook the other side, covering with a lid and leaving for 2 to 3 minutes, until the bread is golden and the cheese is melted.",
    "Slice in half and eat while warm."
