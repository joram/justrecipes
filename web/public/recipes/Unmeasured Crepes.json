    "Beat the eggs. Add the rest of the ingredients, and whisk. Add a bit of salt, \nand taste. If you don’t want to taste the eggs raw, heat a pan, drizzle a bit of \nthe batter into it, then taste it cooked.",
    "Heat a nonstick pan, or put a lightly oiled one over medium heat. Add a \nladleful of batter, just enough to thinly coat the bottom of the pan. Cook until the edges just begin to brown, probably about 30 seconds. Flip — this is not at all delicate, though it seems as though it should be — and cook about 10 seconds.",
    "Cook as many crepes as you want, stacking them on a plate and covering them with a cloth towel until you’re ready to eat. Serve with a whole array of \nthings you might like to put in them."
