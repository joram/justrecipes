  "instructions": [
    "Spray a 9-by-13-inch pan with cooking spray and line with parchment paper. Place 8 tablespoons/115 grams of the butter in a small skillet and melt over medium heat; set aside.",
    "Place the cookies and 1/4 teaspoon salt in the bowl of a food processor fitted with the blade attachment, and process until the cookies are very finely ground. Add the melted butter and pulse until the crumbs are moistened. Transfer the crumb mixture to the prepared pan and press into an even layer, packing the crust lightly with the bottom of a measuring cup. Place the pan in the freezer for 30 to 45 minutes, until the crust is firm to the touch.",
    "Meanwhile, add the remaining 1 tablespoon butter to the skillet and melt over medium heat. Add the nuts and the remaining 1/2 teaspoon salt and cook for 3 to 5 minutes, tossing often, until lightly toasted. Set aside to cool completely.",
    "Soften the ice cream in the refrigerator for 30 minutes, or at room temperature for 10 to 15 minutes until easy to scoop but not melted.",
    "Scoop large spoonfuls of ice cream all over the crust, and working quickly, use an offset spatula or wooden spoon to smooth the ice cream into an even layer with no gaps. Sprinkle the nut mixture and marshmallows over the ice cream and press them lightly into an even layer using the palms of your hands.",
    "Cover the pan with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 3 hours or overnight. Cut the ends of the ice cream away from the edges of the pan and lift the overhanging parchment paper to remove the bars. Place on a cutting board and cut into squares. Serve straight from the freezer, drizzled with hot fudge, if desired."
