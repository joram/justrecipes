    "Make the shrub: Peel lemons with a vegetable peeler, avoiding pith. Juice lemons and set juice aside. Place peels and sugar in a Mason jar, seal and shake. Leave jar in the sun for 3 to 4 hours or overnight. Add reserved lemon juice and shake until sugar is dissolved. Will keep for several days refrigerated.",
    "In a gallon bowl or pitcher, combine shrub (peels and all) with all the liquids; stir gently. Add a 1-quart block of ice (made by freezing a quart container of water overnight). Grate nutmeg on top and ladle into small serving glasses."
