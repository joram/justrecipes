  "instructions": [
    "Remove the label from the can of sweetened condensed milk, running it under hot water if necessary for easier peeling.",
    "Place the can in a large, deep saucepan or stock pot and fill with water to cover by at least 3 inches. Bring to a boil, then lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, for 3 hours, checking the water level every 20 minutes and adding more water as necessary to keep the can submerged. (This is very important as the can might explode if not entirely submerged.) Remove the can with tongs and cool completely before opening and serving.",
    "Serve warm, or cool completely before transferring to an airtight container. Store in the refrigerator, covered, for up to 2 weeks."
