  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 400. Wash beets well. Wrap individually in foil and put them on cookie sheet or roasting pan. (If you&rsquo;re planning to use them all at once, right away, just put in roasting pan or heavy skillet, and cover.)",
    "Cook, undisturbed, for at least 45 minutes (it could take much longer for big ones), until a thin-bladed knife pierces one with little resistance. They may cook at different rates; remove each when it is done. Store, refrigerated, for a couple of days before using; their jackets will slip off easily."
