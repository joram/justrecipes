  "instructions": [
    "Heat a 12-inch skillet, preferably nonstick, over medium-high heat for about 2 minutes. While it is heating, sprinkle the chicken breasts with salt and pepper, and place the flour or cornmeal on a plate.",
    "Pour the oil or clarified butter into the skillet to a depth of 1/8 inch, and turn the heat to high. When the oil is hot, dredge the cutlets in the coating, turning them a few times and pressing them down so they are well covered. After you dredge each one, add it to the pan.",
    "Cook until the chicken is nicely brown, 3 to 5 minutes, then turn. Cook 2 to 4 minutes until the chicken is firm to the touch (lower the heat if the coating begins to scorch).",
    "Meanwhile, if using the optional butter, melt over medium heat until it is nut-brown.",
    "When the chicken is done, drain it briefly on a paper towel, then transfer to a warm platter. Drizzle with lemon juice, and top with half the parsley. At the last minute, pour the browned butter over the chicken, add the remaining parsley and serve."
