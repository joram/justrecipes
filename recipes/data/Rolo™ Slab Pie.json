  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 450°F. On lightly floured work surface, unroll and stack pie crusts one on top of the other. Roll to 17x12-inch rectangle. Fit crust into 15x10x1-inch pan, pressing firmly into corners and sides. Fold extra crust under, even with edges of pan. Using fork, prick all over bottom and sides.",
    "Bake 10 to 12 minutes or until golden brown and completely baked. Cool completely on cooling rack, about 30 minutes.",
    "In small microwavable bowl, place 2 tablespoons of the hot fudge topping. Cover bowl with plastic wrap, refrigerate for later use. Carefully spread remaining hot fudge topping evenly on baked crust.",
    "In medium bowl, beat pudding mix and milk with whisk about 2 minutes or until thick. Beat in 1/2 cup caramel sauce and 1 cup whipped topping until blended. Pour over fudge layer; evenly spread. Refrigerate about 3 hours or until set.",
    "When ready to serve, carefully spoon and spread remaining whipped topping over pudding layer. Sprinkle halved Rolo™ caramels over top. Remove plastic from small bowl; microwave reserved 2 tablespoons hot fudge topping uncovered on High 10 to 20 seconds or until thin enough to drizzle. Drizzle warmed sauce and remaining 2 tablespoons caramel sauce over top.",
