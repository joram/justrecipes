    "Inspect six 8-ounce jars for cracks and rings for rust, discarding any defective ones. Immerse in simmering water for 10 minutes. Wash new, unused lids and rings in warm, soapy water.",
    "Meanwhile, combine pears, water, and lemon juice in a large saucepan. Cover and simmer for 10 minutes. Stir in pectin, and bring to a full boil. Stir in white sugar; boil and stir until sugar is dissolved, about 1 minute. Remove from heat; stir in brown sugar, allspice, and nutmeg.",
    "Pack pear preserves into hot, sterilized jars, filling to within 1/2 inch of the top. Run a clean knife or thin spatula around the insides of the jars to remove any air bubbles. Wipe rims with a moist paper towel to remove any residue. Top with lids and screw rings on tightly.",
    "Place a rack in the bottom of a large stockpot and fill halfway with water. Bring to a boil and lower jars 2 inches apart into the boiling water using a holder. Pour in more boiling water to cover jars by at least 1 inch. Bring to a rolling boil, cover, and process for 10 minutes.",
    "Remove the jars from the stockpot and let rest, several inches apart, for 12 to 24 hours. Press the center of each lid with a finger to ensure the lid does not move up or down. Remove the rings for storage and store in a cool, dark area."
