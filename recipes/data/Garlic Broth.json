  "instructions": [
    "Smash the garlic heads, separating the cloves. Smash and peel the cloves, and cut in half lengthwise. If necessary, remove the green germ that grows through the center.",
    "In a medium saucepan, warm the oil over low heat. Stir in the garlic, and cook, stirring often, for about 20 minutes or until the outside is translucent and the garlic is soft. Do not let the garlic brown.",
    "Add 9 cups of water, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer, uncovered, for 40 minutes. The garlic will be very tender. If using the broth on its own, season to taste."
