    "Peel the oranges, cutting away all the white pith. Using a sharp stainless steel knife, carefully cut the juicy flesh from the membranes that surround it. Discard the membranes and any seeds. There should be about 5 cups of flesh.",
    "Put one-fourth of the orange sections in a crystal bowl and add half a cup of the coconut and half a cup of banana slices. Sprinkle with one-fourth of the sugar. Continue making layers until all the ingredients are used. Sprinkle with enough orange juice to moisten well. Chill and serve."
