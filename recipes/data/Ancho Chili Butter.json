    "Stem the chilies, break them open and shake out all the seeds. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil. Lower the heat, add the chilies and simmer until softened, about 5 minutes. Drain and let cool. Use a small knife to scrape the flesh of the chilies from the skin. Chop the chilies into a paste, and cream together with the butter in a small bowl. Stir in the salt."
