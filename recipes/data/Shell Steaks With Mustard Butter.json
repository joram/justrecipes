    "Trim off all peripheral fat from the steaks. Sprinkle the steaks on both sides with salt and a generous grinding of black pepper.",
    "Put the butter in the container of a food processor or electric blender and add the mustard, Worcestershire sauce, garlic, shallots, parsley, salt and pepper. Blend thoroughly.",
    "Heat a heavy skillet (preferably black iron) until it is almost smoking.",
    "Add one steak at a time and cook until almost blackened on one side, about 2 to 3 minutes. Turn and cook on the other side about 2 to 3 minutes. If your stove has a ventilating fan, it is best to turn it on because the steaks will smoke. When each steak is done, transfer it to a warm serving dish and spoon butter mixture all over the top.",
    "Continue cooking until all the steaks are done.",
    "Garnish each serving with a portion of the sauteed potatoes with parsley."
