  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread out the cherry halves in the bottom of an 8-inch square (or 9-inch round) baking dish. Set aside.",
    "In a small saucepan, add the honey, butter and salt. Bring to a foaming boil over medium heat, then cook 3 to 4 minutes until the honey thickens, stirring often so it never burns. Remove from the heat and stir in the vanilla — it will spatter slightly — then fold in the almonds and oats, continuing to stir until the oats absorb all the honey syrup.",
    "Drop spoonfuls of the mixture across the cherries, and bake for 22 to 25 minutes or until the almonds are almost a mahogany brown and the cherries are tender and juicy. Remove from the oven and allow to cool for 10 minutes, so the granola hardens slightly, then serve with yogurt."
