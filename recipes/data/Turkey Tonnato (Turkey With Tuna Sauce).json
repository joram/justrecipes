    "Cut the turkey breast across the grain into thin slices, each about one-eighth-inch thick.",
    "Put the drained tuna and capers into the container of a food processor or electric blender and blend. Add the mayonnaise, lemon juice, anchovies and broth. Blend thoroughly.",
    "Spoon about a quarter cup of the sauce into a serving dish and smooth it over. Arrange a quarter of the turkey slices, slightly overlapping, over the sauce. Spoon another layer of sauce on top. Add another layer of turkey slices and more sauce. Continue making layers until all the turkey slices are used.",
    "Finish with a layer of sauce. Garnish the top symmetrically with lemon slices, black olives and parsley. Serve any additional sauce on the side. Serve with tomato slices or a mixed green salad on the side."
