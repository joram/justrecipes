  "instructions": [
    "Put the butter in a large, deep skillet or Dutch over medium heat. When melted, add the onion and cook, stirring, until it softens, about 5 minutes. Add the nuts and cook, stirring almost constantly, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.",
    "Add the bread crumbs and the herbs and toss to mix. Turn the heat down to low. Add the salt, pepper and scallions. Toss again; taste and adjust the seasoning. Add the parsley and stir. Turn off the heat. (At this point, you may refrigerate the stuffing, well wrapped or in a covered container, for up to a day before proceeding.)",
    "Pack into a turkey if you like before roasting, or just bake in an ovenproof glass or enameled baking dish for about 45 minutes at 350 to 400. (You can also cook it up to 3 days in advance and just warm it up right before dinner.)"
