    "In a large pot of well-salted water, cook pasta according to package directions.",
    "As pasta cooks, in a small bowl, combine 1 tablespoon olive oil, the tomatoes and a pinch each of salt and red pepper, and toss to combine. Set aside to marinate.",
    "In a large skillet or Dutch oven, heat 1/2 cup extra-virgin olive oil over medium. Stir in shallots and saut√© until tender, about 5 minutes. Stir in garlic and cook 1 minute, or until the edges just begin to turn golden brown. Add red pepper, 1/2 teaspoon salt, lemon zest, beans and 1 cup chopped parsley. Simmer, mashing some of the beans, until the sauce has thickened, 10 to 15 minutes. Reduce heat as needed. Taste for seasoning, and add more salt and red pepper if needed.",
    "Reserve 1 cup pasta water and drain pasta. Add pasta to white beans, along with remaining 1/2 cup chopped parsley, the juice of half a lemon, the grated Parmesan and 1/2 cup reserved pasta water. Toss until combined, adding more pasta water until the mixture is saucy. Toss in the tomatoes and their liquid. Taste, and add more salt and lemon juice if needed. Serve pasta in bowls drizzled with olive oil and topped with more grated Parmesan."
