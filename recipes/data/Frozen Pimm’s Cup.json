    "Make the lemon simple syrup: Combine the lemon juice and sugar in a small saucepan and bring to a simmer over medium-low, stirring occasionally. Remove from the heat and stir to dissolve any remaining sugar granules. Transfer to a heat-proof container and cool completely before using. (Leftover syrup will keep for up to 1 week in the refrigerator.)",
    "Place 4 cups of the ice cubes in a blender and pulse on low speed to crush them. (It’s OK if they are not completely crushed.) Add 1/2 cup Pimm’s, 1/4 cup ginger beer, 1/3 cup simple syrup and a pinch of salt. Blend on low speed, raising the speed slowly and pausing to stir if necessary, until the mixture is smooth and slushy in consistency (see Tip).",
    "Pour the mixture into 3 tumblers and repeat with the remaining 1/2 cup Pimm’s, 1/4 cup ginger beer, 1/3 cup simple syrup and another pinch salt to make 3 more drinks.",
    "Top each drink with a splash of ginger beer, then garnish with a cucumber slice, a strawberry slice, an orange or lemon slice and a basil or mint sprig. Drinks are best served within 15 minutes, with a straw for easy drinking."
