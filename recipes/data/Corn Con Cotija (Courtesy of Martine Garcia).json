    "The corn may be boiled, in which case remove the husks, place corn in a pot of rapidly boiling water and remove to a warm platter after 5 minutes. Then cover with a towel. Or it may be roasted, in which case remove the outer husk, brush the ears with cooking oil and place them beneath a preheated broiler and broil 3 inches from the heat source, turning from time to time, until the kernels begin to brown, about 15 minutes in all.",
    "When corn is cool enough to be handled, spread it with sour cream, then roll in grated cotija."
