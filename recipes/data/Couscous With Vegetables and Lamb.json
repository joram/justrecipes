  "instructions": [
    "Place the lamb, onion, ginger and turmeric in the bottom of a couscoussier or a large pot that can be fitted with a steamer. Add the butter or oil, season with salt and pepper and cook over medium heat about 5 minutes, stirring from time to time.",
    "Add 12 cups water, the tomatoes, saffron, cinnamon sticks and cayenne pepper. Bring to a simmer and cook, covered, for an hour.",
    "While the lamb mixture is cooking, place the couscous in a bowl. Gradually stir in 4 cups water, then drain. Spread the moistened couscous in a large flat pan or dish with sides. Allow the moist couscous to sit 10 to 15 minutes, then break up any lumps with a fork or your fingers.",
    "Remove the lid from the couscoussier or pot and place the perforated section or the steamer on top. Take a length of cheesecloth or other cloth, moisten it and fit it tightly around the seam between the two parts of the pot, to prevent steam from escaping. Spoon half the couscous into the top section and when the steam starts rising through it, add the remaining couscous. Steam, uncovered, for 15 minutes.",
    "Remove the top of the couscoussier and replace the cover on the bottom pot. Dump the steamed couscous back into the flat pan. Allow it to cool a few minutes, then gradually sprinkle it with a cup of cold water and season it with about 1/2 teaspoon salt, or to taste. Using your fingers, gently work the couscous to break up any lumps. Spread it evenly and allow it dry for up to an hour.",
    "Add the turnips, carrots and raisins to the pot. Tie the parsley and coriander together, and add them. Simmer, covered, for 45 minutes.",
    "After about 2 hours' cooking, the lamb should be tender. Cut the zucchini in half crosswise and cut each piece in half lengthwise. Add the zucchini to the pot, and follow with the pumpkin. Drain the chick peas, and add them. Check the seasonings in the pot. If necessary, add a little more water, enough to keep the ingredients covered with liquid.",
    "Replace the steamer top on the pot and wrap it again with the cloth. Rake the couscous once more, then return half of it to the steamer. When the steam begins to rise, add the remaining couscous. Steam, uncovered, 15 minutes. The couscous should be light, fluffy and tender.",
    "To serve, spoon half the couscous onto a large round platter. Make a well in the center. With a slotted spoon remove the pieces of lamb from the pot and pile them in the center. Top them with some of the vegetables. Mound the rest of the couscous over these ingredients. Then, place the remaining vegetables around the couscous and on top of it. Discard the parsley and coriander.",
    "Reheat the broth briefly, and spoon it into 1 or 2 bowls. Serve the couscous with the broth on the side and, if desired, hot pepper sauce."
