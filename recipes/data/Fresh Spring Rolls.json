  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil and make an ice bath by filling a large bowl with ice and cold water. When the water is boiling, turn off the heat, add the shrimp and cook until opaque throughout, about 1 minute. Use a slotted spoon to transfer the shrimp to the ice bath. ",
    "Add the noodles to the hot water and let sit, with the heat off, until tender, 10 to 20 minutes, depending on the brand. While the noodles are soaking, halve the cucumbers crosswise, quarter lengthwise, then thinly slice into thin matchsticks. Remove the ribs from the lettuce leaves. Using the large holes of a box grater, grate the carrot until you have 3/4 cup. ",
    "When the shrimp are cool enough to handle, pat dry; reserve the water bath. When the noodles are ready, drain and transfer them to the ice bath to cool. Place a shrimp on a cutting board on its side and press down with your non-dominant hand. Slice the shrimp in half lengthwise from head to tail and remove the black vein. Set aside and repeat with remaining shrimp.",
    "When ready to assemble, drain and shake dry the noodles. Fill a large, deep dish or pie plate with a couple inches of warm water and gather all your ingredients at your work surface.",
    "Working one at a time, submerge a rice paper wrapper in the warm water for 3 seconds; the wrapper will still be firm. Transfer to a work surface (avoid wood, which can dry out the wrapper). Pretend the wrapper is a clock face: fold the lettuce in half and place between 4 and 8 o’clock, leaving a 1-inch border on both sides. Top the lettuce with about 2 tablespoons of herbs, 1 tablespoon carrots, 4 pieces of cucumber, a pinch of fried shallots (if using) and about 3 tablespoons (1 1/2 ounces) of noodles. Press the filling down to flatten. Grab the wrapper at 6 o’clock and pull it snugly over the filling. Roll tightly away from you once so the lettuce is facing up. As you roll, use your fingers to tuck the filling under the wrapper. ",
    "Fold in the short sides (3 and 9 o’clock) over the filling and press to seal (if this is proving difficult, you can leave one or both sides open). Place 3 slices of shrimp cut sides up on the wrapper between the fillings and top of the wrapper (12 o’clock). Continue rolling tightly until sealed. Transfer to a platter and repeat with the remaining wrappers, spacing the finished rolls apart so they don’t touch. When your water is cool, replace it with more warm water as needed. Serve with peanut sauce and/or nước chấm for dipping."
