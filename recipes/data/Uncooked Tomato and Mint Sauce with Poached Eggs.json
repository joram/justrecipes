    "Cut tomatoes in half lengthwise. Place a box grater in a wide bowl, and using the large holes of the grater, grate tomatoes by rubbing the cut side against the grater, with the skin side cupped in your hand. When you feel the holes of the grater against the inside of the tomato skin, you are done.",
    "Turn on a food processor fitted with a steel blade and drop in the garlic. When it is chopped and adhering to the sides of the bowl, stop the machine and scrape down the sides with a spatula. Add tomatoes, salt, pepper, mint and olive oil. Process in the machine for 1-2 minutes, until sauce is frothy. Taste and adjust seasonings.",
    "Poach eggs. Fill a lidded frying pan with water and bring to a boil. Set timer for 4 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon vinegar. One at a time, break eggs into a teacup, then tip from teacup into pan (do this 2 at a time). Immediately turn off heat and cover pan tightly. Leave for 4 minutes. Using a slotted spoon or spatula, carefully remove poached eggs. Set on a towel to drain.",
    "While eggs are poaching, heat tortillas by placing them one at a time directly over the flame, until the edges are charred. If you donâ€™t have a gas stove, wrap in foil and heat for 10 minutes in a 350-degree oven. Place a tortilla on each plate and top with a poached egg. Spoon 3 tablespoons of the sauce over the eggs and serve."
