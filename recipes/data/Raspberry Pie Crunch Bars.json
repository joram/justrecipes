  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees. Grease a 9-by-13-inch baking dish, and line with parchment paper so that there is a 2-inch overhang on the two long sides.",
    "In a food processor, pulse together flour, sugar and salt. Add butter and pulse to fine crumbs. Pulse a few more times until some of the crumbs start to come together, but don’t overprocess; the dough should be somewhat crumbly. (You can also mix the dough in a bowl using two knives or a pastry cutter.)",
    "Press dough into an even layer in the prepared pan. Prick dough all over with a fork. Bake until golden, 30 to 35 minutes. Transfer to a rack. You can bake the crust up to 6 hours ahead, or use it while it’s still hot.",
    "Prepare the filling: In a mixing bowl, gently toss together raspberries, sugar, cornstarch, lemon juice and zest, and salt.",
    "While the crust is baking, make the crumb topping: In a medium bowl, whisk together flour, oats, brown sugar, pecans, nutmeg and salt. Stir in melted butter, pinching the mixture with your fingers, to make 1/2-inch crumbs.",
    "Using the back of a spoon, an offset spatula or a pastry brush, spread jam in an even layer on top of the crust, going all the way to the edges. Evenly spread raspberry mixture on top of jam. Sprinkle the crumb topping over the raspberry layer, keeping some larger clumps.",
    "Bake until the topping is golden brown and the filling is slightly bubbling along the sides, 35 to 45 minutes. Transfer to a rack to cool completely.",
    "To serve, use a sharp knife to release edges. Using parchment overhang, lift and transfer to a cutting board and cut into 24 squares."
