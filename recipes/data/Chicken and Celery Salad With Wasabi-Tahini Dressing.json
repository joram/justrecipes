    "In a medium pot, cover chicken breasts with about 2 inches of water, and season with 2 tablespoons kosher salt. Bring to a boil over high heat, then simmer on low until the chicken is cooked through, about 20 minutes. Once the chicken is cooked, remove it from the pot and let cool.",
    "While the chicken cools, make the dressing: In a medium bowl, whisk together lime juice, tahini, wasabi paste, garlic, sugar and 1/4 cup water until smooth. Season to taste with salt.",
    "Cut celery into 2-inch segments, then cut segments lengthwise into matchsticks and place in a large bowl.",
    "Using two forks or hands, shred the chicken into bite-size pieces and transfer to the bowl with the celery.",
    "Pour dressing over the chicken and celery and toss to coat. Top with celery leaves and sesame seeds, and serve with lime wedges."
