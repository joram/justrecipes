    "Cook the bacon in a large skillet until crisp. Drain on a paper towel, crumble and set aside. Pour 2 tablespoons of bacon fat into a small dish and place in the freezer just until solid. Leave the remaining fat in the skillet and set aside.",
    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Combine the cinnamon, mace and pepper. Place the pork in a roasting pan and rub the spice mixture all over it. Rub the solid bacon fat over the pork. Roast until the pork reaches an internal temperature of 150 to 160 degrees, about 1 hour.",
    "About 25 minutes before the pork is done, whisk together the mustard and vinegar. Whisking constantly, add the olive oil in a slow, steady stream. Season with the salt and pepper. Place in a medium saucepan and set aside.",
    "Place the potatoes in a saucepan, cover with water and simmer, covered, until tender but firm, about 6 minutes. Drain well, cover and keep warm. Place the dressing over low heat until hot, stirring constantly with a whisk. Place the potatoes in a bowl and gently mix in the hot dressing, the scallions and the bacon. Cover and keep warm.",
    "Heat the bacon fat in the skillet over medium-high heat. Add the chicory in batches, tossing until wilted and bright green. Place in a mixing bowl as each batch is done. Toss with salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Slice the pork into 1/4-inch slices and season lightly with salt. Mound the chicory in the center of 8 plates and drape 3 slices of pork over each mound. Surround with the potato salad and serve immediately."
