  "instructions": [
    "Cut the scallions crosswise into 3-inch segments, then very thinly slice them lengthwise into tendrils. (Better yet, employ a scallion cutter for this task, if youâ€™ve got one.) Add ice water to a medium bowl, then plunge the sliced scallions into the cold water, agitate them with open fingers, and let them sit until they curl and furl, at least 10 minutes.",
    "While the scallions chill, in a second medium bowl, stir together the gochugaru, sugar, sesame seeds and salt. Add the vinegar and sesame oil; stir to combine.",
    "Just before serving, transfer the scallions to a salad spinner or kitchen towel to gently dry them off. Add to the dressing and toss to coat. Serve immediately."
