  "instructions": [
    "In a medium, heavy-bottomed pot, bring milk, cocoa powder, rice, brown sugar and salt to a boil over medium heat, stirring occasionally. (The cocoa powder will not incorporate fully until the milk is warm.) Immediately reduce the heat to medium-low to maintain a gentle simmer.",
    "Cook, stirring often, until the milk has reduced and thickened and the rice is very tender, about 20 minutes. Remove the pot from the heat and stir in the egg yolks, maple syrup and vanilla. It will look loose at this point, but it will thicken as it cools.",
    "Serve warm or chilled, with whipped cream and a sprinkle of cocoa, if you like. Refrigerate, in an airtight container, for up to 2 days."
