    "Heat the oven to 400 degrees. Spread chickpeas out evenly on a sheet pan and roast until crisp and golden in spots, shaking the pan occasionally, about 20 to 25 minutes. Turn off the oven and let the chickpeas hang out for another 10 to 15 minutes, checking in occasionally to make sure they do not burn. This will help keep them crunchy for an extended period of time.",
    "In a 10-inch skillet, heat the olive oil over medium-low heat. Add chickpeas and toss to coat in the oil. Stir in Aleppo pepper and season well with salt. Remove from heat and sprinkle with the lemon zest and toss again. Serve warm. Store any leftovers in an airtight container for up to a week."
