  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl using your hands or a large spoon, combine the beef, onion and the juices, parsley, cilantro, mint, sweet paprika, cumin, salt, black pepper and cayenne. ",
    "Take about 1/2 teaspoon of the kefta mixture, cook it (in a pan or in the microwave) and taste it to check the seasoning. Add more salt to the kefta mixture if necessary. ",
    "Take about 2 1/2 tablespoons of the kefta mixture (slightly larger than a golf ball) and mold it onto a skewer to form a log. (If using a long skewer, form two logs on each.) Repeat until you've used all the kefta mixture. Place the skewers on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to cook.",
    "Heat your grill or grill pan to medium-high and cook for 3 to 4 minutes on each side, until cooked through, using a thin spatula to help turn if the kefta sticks. Serve immediately with bread and a side of vegetables or a salad."
