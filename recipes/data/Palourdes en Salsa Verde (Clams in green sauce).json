    "Rinse clams individually in cold water to remove all sand. Drain.",

    "When the clams have started to open, add the pepper flakes, scallions and parsley. Cover and cook briefly until all the clams have opened.",
    "Blend the cornstarch with the two remaining tablespoons of wine and stir it into the sauce.",
    "Meanwhile, put the frozen peas into a small sieve. Run under very hot water about 15 seconds, just until the peas separate. Add the peas to the clams, heat and serve."
