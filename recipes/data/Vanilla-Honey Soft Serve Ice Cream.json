  "instructions": [
    "In a large bowl, whisk together yolks, sugar, honey, vanilla and salt until smooth.",
    "In a medium saucepan over medium heat, bring cream to a simmer.",
    "Whisking the yolks constantly, slowly pour half the hot cream into the egg mixture. Scrape custard back into saucepan and cook over medium-low heat, stirring constantly, until custard is thick enough to coat the back of a spoon (180 degrees on an instant-read or candy thermometer). Do not let mixture come to a simmer or it could curdle. Strain into a heatproof bowl and whisk in cream cheese until completely melted.",
    "Nestle bowl in a larger bowl filled with ice water. Using a hand mixer or immersion blender, whip custard until thick and cold, about 5 minutes. Spoon mixture into 3 or 4 ice cube trays. Freeze for at least 3 hours or overnight (or up to 1 week).",
    "Using an offset spatula or butter knife, pop out ice cream cubes. Transfer to a food processor or blender. Pulse cubes with milk until the ice cream is smooth and has the consistency of soft serve. Serve immediately, or return to container and freeze for up to 1 week."
