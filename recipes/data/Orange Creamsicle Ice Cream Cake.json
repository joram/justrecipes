  "instructions": [
    "Uncover the orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream and let sit at room temperature while you prepare the crust. Cover the bottom of an 8-by-2-inch springform pan with a layer of vanilla wafers (see Tip). Break up cookies to fill any big holes.",
    "Using a soup spoon, scoop small, alternating spoonfuls of the orange sherbet and vanilla ice cream and place them randomly on top of the cookies (imprecision is good here). Gently press the ice cream down with the back of the spoon and tap the pan on the counter to fill in the pan and remove any air bubbles. Continue until youâ€™ve used all the ice cream, then spread the top into an even layer. To create decorative swoops on top, press down into the cake with the back of the spoon and move it up and out in circular motions to create swirls and peaks all over.",
    "Cover the cake with plastic wrap and freeze until firm, at least 2 hours or up to 1 week. To serve, quickly rub the side and bottom of the pan with a warm, moistened kitchen towel to loosen. Unmold the springform and transfer the cake to a serving plate."
