    "Pour roughly half of the pomegranate juice into a saucepan. Heat over medium, taking care to remove from the flame before it boils. Stir in the sugar until dissolved, then add the other half-quart of juice, the rose water and orange flower water. Mix well and decant into a clean bottle to refrigerate. Adding 2 ounces or so of high-proof vodka or Everclear will allow it to keep longer."
