    "Preheat the oven to 350°F.",
    "In a medium bowl, mix together the graham cracker crumbs and sugar. Add the melted butter, using your fingertips to incorporate it with the graham cracker mixture. Spread the graham cracker mixture evenly across the bottom and sides of a 9-inch pie plate so that it covers the entire dish. There should be no gaps in the crust. Bake the crust for about 5 minutes, or until it’s golden brown. Cool the pie shell for 30 minutes before adding your desired filling."
