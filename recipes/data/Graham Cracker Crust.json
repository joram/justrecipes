    "In a medium bowl, combine graham cracker crumbs, sugar and salt. Stir in the melted butter. (Mixture will look like wet sand.) Press into the bottom and up the sides of a standard (not deep-dish) 9-inch pie pan. Fill and bake according to your recipe. (If your recipe calls for a prebaked crust, bake for 6 to 9 minutes at 375 degrees until just lightly browned. Let cool completely on wire rack before filling.)"
