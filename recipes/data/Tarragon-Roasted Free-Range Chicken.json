    "Preheat the oven to 450 degrees. In a bowl, combine the butter, tarragon, shallot, zest, lemon juice, 1/4 teaspoon salt and 1/8 teaspoon pepper. Mash with a spoon until smooth.",
    "Remove the giblets and excess fat from the cavity of the chicken and sprinkle it inside and out with salt and pepper. Using your fingers, loosen the skin over the breast and work 2/3 of the butter mixture into the space between the skin and breast meat. Rub the remaining butter mixture over the skin and in the cavity. Place the reserved tarragon stems in the cavity.",
    "Transfer the bird to a roasting pan fitted with a rack and roast for 15 minutes. Lower the heat to 375 degrees and continue to roast until the juices run clear when the flesh is pricked with a fork at the thickest part of the thigh, about 1 hour to 1 hour and 15 minutes. Remove from oven and let stand for 10 minutes before serving."
