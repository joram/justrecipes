    "Combine the raspberries, sugar and lemon juice in a large skillet. Set over medium heat and stir until the sugar dissolves and starts to boil, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook, stirring often and gently smashing the berries, until the liquid thickens to the consistency of syrup, 4 to 5 minutes. Skim off and discard any pale pink foam on the surface. Remove from the heat.",
    "Cool until warm or room temperature to use immediately or transfer to a jar and refrigerate until ready to use. The jam can be refrigerated for up to 1 week."
