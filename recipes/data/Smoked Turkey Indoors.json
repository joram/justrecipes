    "Make rub: place salt, poultry seasoning, garlic powder and pepper in a small bowl, and stir to mix.",
    "Remove giblets from turkey. Remove fat from main cavity. Rinse turkey, inside and out, under cold running water, then blot dry, inside and out, with paper towels.",
    "Place turkey on a sheet pan with sides. Sprinkle 1/3 of rub inside both cavities. Truss if desired. Sprinkle with remaining rub.",
    "Set up a smoker, placing 3 tablespoons hardwood sawdust in center of bottom. Line a drip pan with foil, and place it on top of sawdust. Oil a wire rack and insert it in smoker. Put turkey, breast side up, on rack. Tent bird with heavy-duty aluminum foil, crimping edges over rim of smoker to make a seal. Ideally, foil will not touch turkey.",
    "Place smoker over high heat for 3 minutes, then reduce heat to medium, and continue smoking for 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Remove foil from turkey, being careful to avoid steam. Paint bird with melted butter. Remove sawdust from smoker, then place smoker bottom with bird in it in the oven. Roast turkey until skin is crisp and golden brown and bird is cooked through, 1 1/4 to 1 1/2 hours more, basting once or twice more. Turkey is done when internal temperature of thigh is 180 degrees.",
    "Transfer turkey to a platter, loosely tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Reserve any drippings for gravy."
