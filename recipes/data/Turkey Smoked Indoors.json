    "Drain bird. Blot dry inside and out and truss if desired.",
    "Set up a stovetop smoker, placing 3 tablespoons hardwood sawdust in center of bottom. Place a drip pan on top. Lightly oil a wire rack, and insert it in smoker. Arrange turkey, breast side up, on rack. Tent bird with a large sheet of heavy-duty aluminum foil, crimping edges over rim of smoker bottom to seal. Ideally, foil will not touch turkey.",
    "Place smoker over high heat and smoke for 3 minutes, then reduce heat to medium and continue smoking for 30 minutes. Heat oven to 350 degrees. Remove and discard foil, taking care to avoid steam, and paint bird with melted butter. Put smoker bottom with bird in it in the oven. Roast turkey until skin is crisp and golden and bird is cooked through, 1 1/2 to 1 3/4 hours, basting once or twice. (Turkey is done when the internal temperature of thigh is 180 degrees.)",
    "Transfer turkey to a platter, loosely tent with foil, and let rest for 10 minutes before carving. Reserve any drippings for gravy."
