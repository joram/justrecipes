    "In a saucepan over medium heat, bring honey, lemon juice and 1 cup water to a boil, whisking until honey dissolves. Remove from heat and whisk in zest and gin. Pour mixture into a shallow dish. Freeze for 1 hour, then stir with a fork. Freeze for 40 minutes more, then rake with fork, repeating every 40 minutes until granita is icy and slushy (about 3 hours total). Serve in cocktail glasses."
