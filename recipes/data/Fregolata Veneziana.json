  "instructions": [
    "In a blender or food processor fitted with a steel blade, grind almonds with 2 to 3 tablespoons granulated sugar to a coarse powder. Add remaining sugar and process to a very fine powder.",
    "Transfer to the bowl of a mixer or a large mixing bowl and beat in the butter until blended. Add egg yolks, lemon juice, lemon zest and the vanilla and almond extracts, and mix until well blended. Add cornmeal, flour and salt to almond mixture and stir just until the dough comes together. It is important not to overwork dough.",
    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Butter a 9- or 10-inch tart or quiche pan, preferably with a removable bottom. Spread dough in pan, using fingers to distribute dough to the edge. Sprinkle with the chopped nuts and brown sugar.",
    "Bake 5 minutes. Reduce heat to 300 degrees and bake 45 to 50 minutes longer, until surface is pale golden brown. Cool completely on a rack and cut into wedges to serve."
