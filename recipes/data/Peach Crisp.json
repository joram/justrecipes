  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 375 degrees with a rack in the center.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the peaches, granulated sugar, lemon juice, cornstarch and a pinch of salt. Stir to combine, transfer to an 8-by-8 inch baking dish and press down gently to compact the fruit in the dish.",
    "To a medium bowl, add the flour, light brown sugar, oats and 1/4 teaspoon salt; stir to combine. Add the butter and use your fingers or a pastry blender to smash the butter into the flour mixture until evenly mixed and clumps form.",
    "Sprinkle the crumbs evenly over the peaches, then bake the crisp until the topping is golden brown and the peach juices are bubbling, 45 to 50 minutes.",
    "Serve warm, with vanilla ice cream on top, if using."
