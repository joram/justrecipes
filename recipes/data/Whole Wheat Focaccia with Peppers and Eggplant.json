    "Make the sponge. Combine yeast and water in a large bowl or the bowl of a stand mixer and stir to dissolve. Whisk in flour. Cover with plastic wrap and let proof in a warm place until bubbly and doubled in volume, about 45 minutes.",
    "Make the dough. If using a stand mixer, whisk together yeast and the water in a small bowl and let stand until creamy, a few minutes. Add to sponge in the mixer bowl, along with olive oil. Add flours and salt and mix in with the paddle attachment for 1 to 2 minutes, until the ingredients are amalgamated. Change to the dough hook and knead on medium speed for 8 to 10 minutes. The dough should come together and slap against the sides of the bowl. It will be slightly tacky. To make the dough by hand, combine yeast and water as directed and whisk into sponge along with olive oil. Whisk in all-purpose flour. Add salt and remaining flour, one cup at a time, folding it in with a spatula or a wooden spoon. When you can scrape out the dough, add flour to the work surface, put the dough on top and knead for 8 to 10 minutes, until soft and velvety. Return to bowl (oil the bowl lightly with olive oil first).",
    "Cover bowl tightly with plastic wrap and let dough rise in a warm spot until doubled, about 1 1/2 hours.",
    "Shape the focaccia. Coat a 12-x 17-inch sheet pan (sides and bottom) with olive oil. Line with parchment and flip the parchment over so exposed side is oiled. Turn dough onto the baking sheet. Oil or moisten your hands and press out dough until it just about covers the bottom of the pan. Dough may be sticky. Cover with a towel and allow it to relax for 10 minutes, then continue to press it out until it reaches the edges of the pan. Cover with a damp towel and let rise in a warm spot for 45 minutes to an hour, or until the dough is full of air bubbles.",
    "While the shaped focaccia is proofing, roast eggplant and prepare peppers. Preheat oven to 425 degrees. Line a sheet pan with foil. On the foil, toss eggplant with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil and salt to taste. Arrange in a single layer and place in the hot oven for 15 minutes. Remove from the oven and, taking care not to burn yourself, fold foil over, then crimp the edges so eggplant steams inside the foil. Keep oven on and place a baking stone in it if using one.",
    "Heat another tablespoon of olive oil in a large skillet over medium heat and add onion. Cook, stirring, until it begins to soften, about 3 minutes, and add garlic, peppers, and chile pepper if using. Add salt to taste and cook, stirring often, until peppers have softened, about 5 minutes. Add tomato and marjoram and cook, stirring, for another 5 to 10 minutes, until peppers are soft and tomato has cooked down. Taste and adjust seasoning. Remove from the heat.",
    "With lightly oiled fingertips or with your knuckles, dimple dough, pressing down hard so you leave indentations. Spread peppers over the dough and arrange the eggplant slices here and there. Drizzle on the final tablespoon of oil. Place pan in oven on baking stone. Spray oven 3 times with water during the first 10 minutes of baking, and bake 20 to 25 minutes, until edges are crisp and the top is golden. If you wish, remove focaccia from the pan and bake directly on the stone during the last 10 minutes. Remove from oven, remove from pan at once and cool on a rack. If you want a softer focaccia, cover with a towel when you remove it from the oven. Serve warm or at room temperature. Sprinkle slivered or torn fresh basil leaves over the top before serving."
