    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees. Cut off and discard the tough green tops of the leeks. Slice the leeks in half lengthwise and rinse well to remove grit. Cut the leeks on the diagonal into 1/2-inch slices, transfer to a 13-by-9-inch baking dish and toss them with the salt and pepper. Drizzle with the wine, dot with the butter and cover the dish tightly with foil.",
    "Place the leeks in the oven and bake until they are very soft, about 70 minutes. Serve 2 cups with the <a href='http://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/9866'>roasted chickens</a> and refrigerate the remaining 2 cups for other uses."
