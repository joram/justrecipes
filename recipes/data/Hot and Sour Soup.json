  "instructions": [
    "In a large (5-quart) pot, combine the broth, soy sauce, red pepper flakes, and 2 cups water. Bring to a boil over medium heat. Add the mushrooms; reduce the heat, and simmer until tender, about 10 minutes.",
    "In a small bowl, whisk together 3 tablespoons of the vinegar and the cornstarch. Add to the pot; simmer, stirring, until the soup is thickened, about 1 minute.",
    "Add the egg through a slotted spoon, and stir to form ribbons. Stir in the tofu. Remove from the heat; let stand, covered, for 1 minute. Put the ginger in a small sieve, and squeeze to release its juice into the soup (discard the solids). Taste; add the remaining tablespoon vinegar, if desired. Serve sprinkled with the scallions.",
    "Be sure to drain the tofu thoroughly before adding it to the soup so it will soak up the flavor of the broth."
