  "instructions": [
    "In the bowl of a standing mixer, whisk together dry ingredients. Add oil and half the wine. Use the paddle attachment to mix on medium-low speed for 12 minutes, adding remaining wine occasionally. Dough will be springy and moist but not sticky. If it is sticky, refrigerate 30 minutes and mix again. Add more flour a little bit at a time if needed.",
    "Heat oven to 375 degrees, or 350 degrees with convection.",
    "Prepare 2 baking sheets with parchment paper or nonstick liners. Pull off a piece of dough (about 1/4 ounce or 8 grams) and roll on a work surface into a 5-inch rope tapered at both ends. Shape into a coil (or a ring, with the ends crossed over) and gently pinch to seal. Transfer to prepared pan. Repeat with remaining dough, working in batches if necessary. (Can be made up to this point and frozen. Freeze on sheet pans, then transfer to freezer bags for storage. Do not thaw before baking.) ",
    "Bake 15 to 20 minutes, rotating pans halfway through baking, until golden brown. (Add 3 to 5 minutes if baking from frozen.) Cool before serving. Will keep up to a week in a sealed container."
