    "Shell and devein the langoustines or shrimp, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Rub all over with 1 tablespoon of the olive oil. Set aside.",
    "If the langoustines or shrimp are to be grilled, preheat a gas- or wood-burning grill until it is quite hot.",
    "Bring enough water to a boil to cover the haricots verts when they are added. Add the beans, and let simmer 5 minutes. Drain and drop the beans immediately into a basin of ice water. Drain thoroughly and chill. Cut each bean into 2-inch lengths. Set aside.",
    "Cut the mushroom caps crosswise in half. Scrape away and discard the black gills inside. Cut the mushroom caps and stems into the thinnest possible slices. There should be about 3/4 cup. Set aside.",
    "Remove and discard the tomato seeds. Cut the flesh into 1/4-inch cubes. There should be about 1 1/4 cups.",
    "Pull away and discard the tough outer leaves of each artichoke. Cut away and discard the bottom stems of each. Using a sharp paring knife, trim all around the sides and base of each artichoke until each is smooth and white, with the green exterior pared away. As you work, rub the cut portions with half a lemon to prevent discoloration. Using a melon-ball scoop or spoon, trim away and discard the center fuzzy portion of each artichoke. Cut the artichokes into quarters, and slice each piece as thinly as possible. There should be about 2/3 cup.",
    "Put the haricots verts, mushrooms, tomatoes and artichokes into a bowl. Add salt and pepper to taste.",
    "Combine 8 tablespoons of the olive oil, the lemon and truffle juices and salt and pepper to taste in a mixing bowl. Beat with a wire whisk to blend. Pour this over the vegetables, and toss to blend. Spoon the vegetable mixture into the center of an oval or circular plate.",
    "If the langoustines or shrimp are to be grilled, place them on the grill, and cook about 2 minutes. Turn and cook about 3 minutes or until done. Cooking time will depend on the size of the shellfish. Do not overcook. If the langoustines or shrimp are to be cooked in a skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the olive oil, and cook, shaking the skillet and stirring, about 5 minutes or until the shellfish are cooked through.",
    "Arrange the hot langoustines or shrimp around the vegetables, and spoon 1 tablespoon of olive oil over the shellfish. Garnish the dish with sprigs of chervil or parsley."
