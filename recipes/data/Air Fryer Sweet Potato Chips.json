    "Slice potato into 1/16-inch-thick rounds using a mandoline. Put potato slices in a large bowl of cold water; soak about 20 minutes. Drain and pat dry with paper towels. Wipe out bowl.",
    "Return potato slices to dried bowl. Add oil, salt, and pepper; toss gently to coat.",
    "Preheat air fryer to 350 degrees F (175 degrees C). Lightly coat air fryer basket with cooking spray. Working in batches if needed, arrange potato slices in an even layer in basket (do not overcrowd).",
    "Cook until lightly golden and crispy, 12 to 16 minutes, turning and rearranging chips into an even layer every 4 minutes. Watch closely during the last 2 to 3 minutes of cooking. Check chips about every 30 seconds, using tongs to remove golden chips from the basket as needed to avoid overcooking and ending up with bitter chips.",
