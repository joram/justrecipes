  "instructions": [
    "Prepare your equipment: Clip a candy thermometer to a 4- to 5-quart high-sided pot. (The mixture will bubble pretty vigorously, so make sure your pot is large enough to contain this excitement.) Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Get something to scoop the candy: a 2-ounce ice cream scoop with a thumb lever, two spoons or a ¼-cup measuring cup. (Truthfully, you can make them whatever size you like.)",
    "Combine sugar, butter, cream and baking soda in the pot over medium heat. Stir pretty frequently with a heatproof silicone spatula so the sugar doesn’t scorch. As the mixture begins to boil, it will foam up and rise. Once it boils, start stirring constantly and cook until it reaches 246 degrees on the candy thermometer, 10 to 12 minutes. Scrape the sides and bottom often for even browning. As it cooks, the mixture will settle down then begin to thicken, darken and caramelize.",
    "Once the mixture reaches 246 degrees, carefully add vanilla, pecan halves, chopped pecans and salt. Remove the pot from the heat, tilt it and vigorously continue to stir for 3 to 5 minutes to cool your candy and thicken it. The candy will be matte with a cloudy shininess and light in color.",
    "Using your scoop of choice, drop your pralines onto the prepared sheet pan. Be sure to scoop from the bottom of the pan and stir frequently. ",
    "Allow the candy to set at room temperature for 8 to 12 hours. The pralines will begin to turn opaque around the edges and then gradually stiffen up as they set. When they are fully set up, they will slide easily on the parchment paper and keep their shape.",
    "Store at room temperature for up to a week, ideally wrapped in parchment paper and placed in a tin box."
