    "Core and remove the seeds from the red and green peppers. Cut peppers into thin strips about 1 1/2 inches long.",
    "Slice the meat across the grain into thin strips 1 1/2 to 2 inches long. Place in a bowl and add the cornstarch, soy sauce and pepper flakes and 2 tablespoons of the oil. (The oil keeps the meat from sticking together while cooking.) Blend well and let stand 15 minutes.",
    "Heat the remaining oil in a wok or skillet large enough to hold the ingredients. When the oil is very hot add the meat and cook, stirring, about 30 seconds until separated. Drain the meat in a sieve over a bowl to catch the drippings and reserve the oil.",
    "Wipe out the wok and return 2 tablespoons of the oil to it. Heat the oil and add the peppers, scallions and garlic. Cook over high heat until crisp and tender, about 1 minute. Add the sugar, wine, chicken broth and salt if desired. Add the beef and cook quickly, stirring, until just heated through. Serve immediately."
