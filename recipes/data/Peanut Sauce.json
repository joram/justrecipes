  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl or resealable container, whisk together the peanut butter, lime juice, soy sauce, chili sauce, sugar and garlic. Add warm water, 1 tablespoon at a time, until youâ€™ve reached your desired consistency. (Thicker for a dipping sauce, thinner for a salad dressing.) Sauce will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for up to 4 days. Thin with warm water as needed before using."
