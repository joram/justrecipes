    "Prepare the pickled vegetables: Bring vinegar, sugar and ¾ cup of water to a boil in a small saucepan. Remove from heat and let sit until ready to use. ",
    "Toss carrots, daikon and salt in a large bowl until completely coated and the salt has begun to dissolve. Let sit for 15 minutes; drain and rinse thoroughly in cold water. Squeeze to remove excess water. Transfer to a heatproof jar. Pour vinegar mixture over and let sit at room temperature, uncovered for at least 1 hour before serving. ",
    "Prepare the pork: Combine baking soda and 1 1/4 cups cold water in large bowl. Add pork and toss to coat. Let stand at room temperature for 15 minutes. Rinse pork in cold water and drain well. Rinse and wipe bowl clean; return pork to bowl.",
    "Meanwhile, purée lemongrass, shallot, garlic, palm sugar, fish sauce, cornstarch and oil in a food processor or in a blender until very finely chopped. Pour over pork and toss to coat. Cover tightly and refrigerate for at least 30 minutes and up to 3 hours.  ",
    "Make the dipping sauce: Stir lime juice, granulated sugar, fish sauce, chile, garlic and 2 tablespoons water in a small bowl until sugar has dissolved. Let sit at room temperature until ready to serve.",
    "Prepare a grill for high, direct heat; clean grates well, then brush grates with oil. Alternatively, heat a grill pan on high and brush pan with oil. Grill pork, turning once, until charred on both sides and cooked through, 2 to 3 minutes per side, closing the grill as needed between flips if you are using a gas grill. Transfer steaks to a platter and let cool for 5 minutes before serving.",
    "Top cooked vermicelli with grilled pork and a sprinkle of peanuts. Serve with pickled vegetables, dipping sauce, cucumber, cilantro, mint and lime wedges."
