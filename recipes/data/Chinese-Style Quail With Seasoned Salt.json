  "instructions": [
    "Check quail for any stray bone fragments or feathers. If there are V-shaped grilling pins protruding (these shape the partly boned birds), leave them in place. Rinse, and pat dry with paper towels.",
    "In small skillet or saute pan, combine salt, peppercorns, star anise and cinnamon. Place over high heat, and stir or shake until peppercorns begin to smoke. Set aside, and allow to cool.",
    "Place soy sauce in mixing bowl, add quail, and turn until they are lightly coated. Sprinkle the salt mixture (avoid the whole spices) sparingly inside the quail, and somewhat liberally outside. Put quail on a rack to dry at room temperature for 1 hour.",
    "While quail are drying, remove whole spices (peppercorns, star anise, cinnamon) from the salt, and grind them in spice grinder to a coarse powder. Add all of the remaining salt to the powder, and continue to process until finely ground. Transfer mixture to small serving bowl. Add sugar, and mix well. Set aside.",
    "In large, wide saucepan over medium-high heat, add peanut oil to a depth of at least 2 inches, and heat to about 375 degrees. Add quail, in batches if necessary, and fry until lightly golden, about 3 minutes. Remove, and drain on paper towels.",
    "To serve, remove grilling pins. Use large chef's knife or cleaver to cut each bird in half lengthwise and then diagonally under each thigh. The meat should be slightly pink. Arrange on large platter, and garnish with coriander sprigs. Pass the ground seasoned salt separately for dipping."
