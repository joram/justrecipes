    "Brush a small sheet pan or large plate with a generous amount of butter. Whisk the flour, baking powder, sugar and salt in a large bowl. Rub 1 tablespoon butter into the flour mixture. Make a well in the center and pour in 1 1/4 cups water. Using your hands, mix the dry and wet ingredients into a shaggy dough. Add more water, 2 tablespoons at a time, combining until the dough comes together into a slightly sticky, uneven ball. (You may need a total of 1 1/2 to 2 cups water).",
    "Transfer the dough to a floured work surface and knead lightly together into a ball, 1 to 2 minutes. Cut into 8 even pieces. Roll each piece into a ball and place on the greased pan. Cover with plastic wrap or a clean kitchen towel. Let rest for 1 to 4 hours.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the remaining butter with the coconut oil.",
    "Place a dough ball on a lightly floured work surface and dust the top with flour. Using a rolling pin, pat the dough down, then roll into a 5-inch round. Use a sharp knife to cut a single slit from the middle of the circle to the edge. Very generously spread the butter mixture on the surface, leaving 1/2 inch rim. Starting from one edge of the slit, tightly roll the dough clockwise onto itself to form a cone. Lift the cone with the larger end facing up, fold the edges of the cone over and pinch to seal. Place the sealed end down on your work surface and push the tip of the cone inwards and down to make a depression in the top and slightly flatten the dough. Return the dough to the greased pan, brush with the butter mixture and cover. Repeat with the remaining dough, keeping the dough rounds covered as you work. Allow the dough to rest for 30 minutes.",
    "Place a piece of dough on a floured work surface, ideally next to the stove, and sprinkle flour on top. Roll into a 9-inch round, turning the dough an inch clockwise after each roll to maintain its round shape.",
    "Heat a 10- to 12-inch nonstick or well-seasoned steel skillet over medium. Brush the pan with the butter mixture, place the dough round in the pan and cook until the surface looks dull and the dough begins to puff, 30 to 60 seconds. Brush the surface of the dough lightly with the butter and flip to cook the other side for another 30 seconds. Brush again with the butter and flip until light golden brown spots appear on the bottom, about 30 seconds. Brush lightly with the butter and flip again, putting the edges in direct contact with the pan to cook the rim, about 20 seconds.",
    "Once the edges are cooked, tear up the roti while in the pan by clapping and crushing it together between two spatulas. Repeat this motion until the roti layers break apart and the cooked roti looks like a torn shirt. You can also do this step by transferring the cooked roti to a bowl with a lid and shaking vigorously or by clapping the roti in a clean kitchen towel. Move the roti to a plate lined with a clean kitchen towel and cover to keep warm.",
    "Repeat the rolling, cooking and tearing process with the remaining dough pieces, wiping out the skillet after each is cooked. Serve warm with curry chana and beef curry."
