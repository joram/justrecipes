    "Cut the squash into 2-inch chunks and place in a large pot. Add water to just cover and place over high heat. Cook until the squash is just barely tender, 25 to 40 minutes. (Do not overcook or the squash will become watery.) Drain well.",
    "Transfer the squash to a bowl and use an electric mixer to beat until smooth. Beat in the butter. Beat in the sugar. Season to taste with salt and pepper and stir in the nutmeg."
