  "instructions": [
    "Place mint leaves in a cocktail shaker with sugar cube, lime juice and syrup. Using a muddler or wooden spoon, gently bruise mint. Pour rum in, swirl shaker and pour contents into a 10- or 12-ounce tall glass. Add crushed iced until glass is three-quarters full, then add bitters.",
    "Insert a genuine swizzle stick or a bar spoon into glass, stopping just above mint leaves, and hold its handle between your palms. Slide your hands back and forth against each other, gently spinning spoon or swizzle stick. Ideally, liquid and ice will swirl together while top layer of bitters and bottom layer of mint stay undisturbed. Top with more ice and garnish with a mint sprig."
