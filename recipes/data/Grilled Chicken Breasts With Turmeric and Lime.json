    "Heat a grill or the broiler. Put the oil in a mixing bowl; and lime juice, chile powder, turmeric, rosemary, garlic, salt and pepper. Stir to blend well and add the chicken pieces. Turn them in the marinade to coat well. Cover and set aside until ready to cook. If they are to be marinated for a long period, refrigerate them.",
    "Place chicken pieces on the grill or on the rack under the broiler. Cover the grill or close the door to the broiler. Cook about 2 to 3 minutes and turn the pieces. Continue cooking until done, about 2 to 3 minutes on the grill, possibly a little longer under the broiler. (Keep in mind that when this recipe was developed, in 1985, boneless chicken breasts werenâ€™t nearly as enormous as most are today, so adjust your cook time accordingly.)",
    "Remove the pieces and brush the tops with the melted butter."
