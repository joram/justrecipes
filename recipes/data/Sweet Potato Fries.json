    "Slice the sweet potatoes lengthwise into 1/4-inch-thick slices. Cut the slices into 1/4-inch-wide sticks. Place the sweet potatoes in a large bowl, and sprinkle generously with salt. Let stand for about 20 minutes to release some of their moisture.",
    "Meanwhile, preheat the oven to 450˚F. Place a wire rack on a baking sheet, and set it aside.",
    "Spread the potatoes out on paper towels to absorb any excess moisture. Then place them in a large bowl, and spray them with cooking spray. Sprinkle with the thyme and salt, pepper, paprika, and cayenne to taste. Spread the potatoes out on the prepared baking sheet.",
    "Bake the fries until they are golden and tender, 35 to 45 minutes. Serve immediately.",
    "Eat more sweet potatoes! At only 130 to 160 calories each, they are loaded with complex carbohydrates, protein, vitamins A and C, iron, and calcium—and when eaten with the skin, they have more fiber than a bowl of oatmeal.",
