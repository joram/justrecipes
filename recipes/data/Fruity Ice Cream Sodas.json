  "instructions": [
    "In a large saucepan, heat berries (or cherries) and sugar over medium heat (use 3/4 cup sugar for cherries or blueberries, and 1 cup for raspberries or blackberries). Bring to a simmer and let cook, stirring occasionally, for 5 to 7 minutes, or until the syrup is thick and the fruit has begun to fall apart. Use a fork or potato masher to mash the fruit thoroughly.",
    "Place a fine sieve over a bowl and strain the syrup, using a flexible spatula to push the pur√©e through the sieve. Stir in lemon juice (or vinegar), starting with a teaspoon and adding more to taste. The syrup should be tangy-sweet.",
    "Fill the bottoms of 4 tall glasses with syrup and stir in seltzer until the glass is two-thirds of the way full. Add scoops of ice cream to fill the glass, stir and top with whipped cream, if using. Serve immediately with a straw."
