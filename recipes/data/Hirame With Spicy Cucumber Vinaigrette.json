    "In a food processor, pulse together 1 Japanese cucumber (or half of a small cucumber), the jalapenos and 1/2 teaspoon salt until finely chopped. Transfer to a bowl, stir in the rice vinegar and fish sauce and set aside. Thinly slice the remaining cucumber into 1/8-by-1/8-by-1-inch sticks.",
    "Using a very sharp knife with the blade lying flat, horizontally slice the fluke as thinly as possible. Stack 5 or 6 cucumber sticks and wrap with a slice of fish.",
    "Place 4 fish wraps on each of 4 plates. Spoon the dressing over the fish, sprinkle with lime juice and garnish with cilantro."
