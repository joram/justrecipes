    "Put tangerine juice, confectioners’ sugar and 1/2 cup sake in a blender and whiz briefly to combine. Transfer to the bowl of an ice cream machine, and churn according to manufacturer’s instructions. (It should be about 20 to 30 minutes, until mixture thickens and holds its shape in a spoon.)",
    "Transfer to an airtight container and keep in freezer compartment for at least 2 hours. (Sorbet will keep in the freezer up to two weeks.) To serve, put scoops in small, chilled bowls. Add 2 tablespoons of sake to each bowl. Garnish each with citrus leaf."
