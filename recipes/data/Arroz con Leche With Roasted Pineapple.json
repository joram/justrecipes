  "instructions": [
    "Put rice, lemon peel, cinnamon, vanilla, salt and 2 cups milk in a saucepan over medium-high heat. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat to maintain a simmer.Â ",
    "Continue to cook, stirring continuously, adding more milk, 1/2 cup at a time, as rice absorbs it. Rice should be cooked after 25 minutes. Stir in the light brown sugar. Cook a bit longer if you like the rice softer. The mixture should be relatively loose. Taste and add salt or sugar as needed. Pour rice into an ovenproof serving dish.",
    "Top with pineapple chunks and broil until fruit is lightly browned, about 8 minutes. (Alternatively, bake the dish in a 475-degree oven for 10 minutes, until pineapple browns, or roast pineapple separately.)",
    "Let cool slightly, to serve warm, or serve at room temperature. Top with coconut flakes and pomegranate seeds (if using)."
