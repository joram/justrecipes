  "instructions": [
    "Preheat a gas, charcoal or electric grill until moderately hot. Bring a small saucepan of water to a boil, add garlic and boil 1 minute. Drain. Cut garlic into paper-thin slices and toss in a small bowl with the parsley and a little salt and pepper.",
    "Stuff about 1 teaspoon of the garlic mixture under the skin of each chicken half, in breast and thigh areas. Put chickens on a plate, cover with plastic wrap and refrigerate until ready to use. Reserve remaining garlic mixture.",
    "When ready to cook, grill chicken halves 7 to 10 minutes on each side, until they are just cooked through. Make sure all pinkness disappears but do not overcook.",
    "Meanwhile, melt the butter in a saute pan. Add remaining garlic mixture and saute gently until barely golden. Remove from heat. Add lemon juice and season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Put a chicken half on each of 4 warmed plates and spoon the sauteed garlic mixture over each. Serve at once."
