    "Peel the pears and scoop out the cores from the bottom with the point of a swivel bladed potato peeler. Immerse the pears in water mixed with two tablespoons of the lemon juice.",
    "Bring the Marsala to a simmer in a saucepan that will comfortably hold the pears upright. Add the sugar and cinnamon stick. Once the sugar has dissolved stand the pears up in the pan and cook gently until tender, about 15 minutes. Remove the pears from the pan, draining them well.",
    "Bring the Marsala mixture to a boil and cook rapidly until it is reduced to about three-fourths of a cup and is syrupy. Stir in the remaining lemon juice. Pour the syrup over the pears and cool before serving."
