  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 350 degrees, and place a rack in the center of the oven. In a large bowl, stir together graham cracker crumbs and butter. Transfer mixture to a 9-inch pie plate, and press it into an even layer on the bottom and up the sides.",
    "Place pie plate on a rimmed baking sheet, and transfer to oven. Bake until golden brown, about 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the filling: Halve the orange and squeeze the juice from one half. You should have 1/4 cup. If not, squeeze some juice from the other half. Reserve squeezed halves for zesting for garnish.",
    "In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the whisk attachment, beat egg yolks until pale and fluffy, about 5 minutes. Turn the mixer to low and slowly add condensed milk, scraping sides if needed. Whisk in tamarind and orange juice until just combined, then whisk in the lemon or lime juice and salt.",
    "Scrape mixture into cooled pie shell, then return to oven and bake until filling has just set, 15 to 20 minutes. Transfer to a wire rack to cool to room temperature, then refrigerate until completely chilled, at least 2 hours and up to 1 day.",
    "Just before serving, make the topping: In the bowl of an electric mixer, using the whisk attachment, beat together cream and confectioners' sugar until thick and fluffy. Dollop whipped cream on cooled pie. Finely grate the zest from one of the reserved orange halves over the top of the pie, and serve."
