    "Set out two martini glasses and two saucers wider than the glasses’ rims. In one of the saucers, sprinkle the paprika in a rough circle approximately the diameter of the glasses’ rims; in the other, put an ounce of the clear crème de cacao. Dip each glass rim in the liqueur, tap off the excess liquid, then dip in the paprika to coat.",
    "Put remaining clear crème de cacao, dark crème de cacao and vodkas in a cocktail shaker with ice. Shake until condensation appears. Pour evenly between the two rimmed glasses."
