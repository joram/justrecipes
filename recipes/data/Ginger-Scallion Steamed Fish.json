  "instructions": [
    "In a medium bowl, stir together 1 cup water with the fish and salt. Set aside for 10 minutes. (This quick brine will help the fish stay tender.)",
    "Meanwhile, slice the scallion whites and light green parts into 1-inch-thick segments, then thinly slice the greens for garnish. Peel the ginger and cut into thin matchsticks.",
    "In a large pot or skillet with a lid, combine ½ cup water with the scallion segments, ginger, soy sauce and sugar. Bring to a simmer over medium-high and cook until reduced by about half, 5 to 7 minutes. ",
    "Reduce heat to low, then use a slotted spoon or your fingers to transfer the fish to the pot. (No need to pat it dry first.) Stir to coat in the soy mixture, then shake into an even layer. Cover and cook until the fish is cooked through, 8 to 12 minutes. ",
    "Taste the sauce in the pot and if it’s too salty, stir in a pinch of sugar. Divide the fish among bowls, including the sauce, ginger and scallions, and top with the thinly sliced scallion greens. It’s good warm, at room temperature (you can leave out up to 2 hours), or cold from the fridge (store it for up to 1 day). "
