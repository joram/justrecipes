  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the flour and granulated sugar. Cut in the butter with a pastry blender or two knives to form crumbs with some pebbly bits, then zest the lemons directly into the bowl. In another small bowl, combine the egg and egg yolks. Squeeze 1 tablespoon juice from a lemon and mix into the eggs. Pour the egg mixture into the flour mixture, and gently stir until the dough comes together.",
    "Roll the dough into 1-inch balls and space 2 inches apart on the prepared sheets. Bake, 1 sheet at a time, until the tops look just set and dry, 12 to 13 minutes. Cool completely on the sheets.",
    "Place the confectioners’ sugar in a small bowl. Squeeze 1 1/2 teaspoons juice from a lemon, and stir into the confectioners’ sugar until smooth and the consistency of icing. Add more lemon juice if needed. Drizzle over the cooled cookies. Let stand until set."
