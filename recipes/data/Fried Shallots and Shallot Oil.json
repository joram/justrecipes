    "Heat oil in a wide, heavy skillet over medium-high heat, and line a plate with paper towels. ",
    "Test oil by tossing in a slice of shallot. When it sizzles, gently add remaining shallots and lower heat to medium. Shallots should bubble gently, not furiously. Stir often. After 5 minutes, if shallots have started to brown, reduce heat. They should slowly turn from translucent to golden to brown; the process should take about 15 minutes.",
    "Transfer cooked shallots to lined plate with slotted spoon or tongs, shaking off excess oil. Blot with paper towel and let cool at room temperature for 5 to 10 minutes, until crisp.",
    "Store shallots in an airtight container and use as a crunchy garnish or in salads. Strain oil to remove debris and store in a cool place in an airtight container; can be used for stir-frying or any another purpose. "
