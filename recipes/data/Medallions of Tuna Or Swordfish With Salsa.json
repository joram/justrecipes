  "instructions": [
    "Trim the fish into pieces of equal size, about two inches square. You should have eight to 12 pieces. Remove any skin from the fish. Brush the fish with a tablespoon of the lime juice and allow to marinate to while preparing the salsa.",
    "Drain the tomatoes very well, piercing them so the liquid drains from inside, then chop them. Mix with onion, scallions, chili peppers, coriander and salt and pepper to taste. Add one teaspoon of the olive oil. Set aside.",
    "Heat a cast-iron skillet to very hot. Brush with the remaining teaspoon of olive oil. Dry the fish, place in the skillet and sear three to four minutes on each side, until the fish is lightly browned and cooked to the desired degree of doneness. These types of fish are best if cooked medium-rare.",
    "Top each medallion of fish with a spoonful of the salsa and serve at once."
