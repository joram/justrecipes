  "instructions": [
    "Wash and peel the sweet potatoes, then cut crosswise into 1/2-inch-thick disks. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a medium or large saucepan and cover with water. Bring the sweet potatoes to a boil, then reduce the heat to medium. Cook until the sweet potatoes are al dente and you can pierce their flesh with a fork with pressure, about 5 minutes. Transfer the sweet potatoes to a large, oven-proof cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven.",
    "Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Add the pineapple juice, brown sugar, vanilla and cinnamon to the skillet. Cook over medium until the sugar has dissolved; stir to combine. Arrange the sweet potatoes evenly in the skillet, then add the butter pieces on top.",
    "Use an oven mitt to transfer the skillet to the oven and bake the sweet potatoes, uncovered, stirring occasionally, until tender and their flesh easily yields to the tines of a fork, 30 to 35 minutes.",
    "Transfer the skillet to the stovetop and bring the liquid to a boil, then reduce to a hearty simmer. Cook, until the liquid forms a thick syrup and coats the sweet potatoes, about 3 minutes. Serve warm."
