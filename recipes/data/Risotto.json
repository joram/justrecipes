    "For enough risotto to serve four, heat about 2 tablespoons of butter in a sauce pan. Add 1 cup of a round-grain rice such as Arborio or Carnaroli and stir the rice over medium heat. Add the broth, one cup at a time, until the rice has absorbed 3 cups of liquid. You should stir the risotto frequently as it cooks to get a good creamy texture. (If you like, replace 1/2 cup of the broth with 1/2 cup dry white wine.) For a saffron risotto, add a few threads of crushed saffron with the first cup of broth.",
    "Once the rice is tender and creamy, pull it off the heat and add 2 tablespoon butter and 1/3 to 1/2 cup grated Parmesan cheese. Stir the risotto vigorously until the butter and cheese are blended in. Serve at once on heated plates."
