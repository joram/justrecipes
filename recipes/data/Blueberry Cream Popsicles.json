  "instructions": [
    "In a medium pot, toss the blueberries, lemon juice, sugar and salt to combine. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the berries burst and the mixture becomes juicy, 4 to 5 minutes. (Add 2 to 4 minutes of cook time if you’re using frozen, unthawed berries.",
    "Transfer to the bowl of a food processor or blender and cool for 10 minutes. Purée the mixture until relatively smooth, 30 seconds to 1 minute. Add the sweetened condensed milk and blend until combined, 20 to 30 seconds. Scrape the bowl well.",
    "Add the heavy cream and process until the mixture is well combined and thickens slightly, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Add the sour cream and vanilla and blend until fully incorporated, 30 seconds to 1 minute. If necessary, transfer the mixture to a large container with a spout, such as a 4-cup/1-liter liquid measuring cup. Divide the mixture between the popsicle molds, filling each just under the rim of the cavity of the mold. Gently press a popsicle stick into the center of each cavity and freeze until firm, at least 8 hours.",
    "To unmold, gently run warm water over the base of the molds. They should easily release. Keep frozen until ready to serve."
