  "instructions": [
    "Spread the watermelon cubes on a sheet pan or other tray and freeze until firm, about 3 hours. Once the cubes are frozen, transfer them to a freezer-safe container and store for up to 1 week.",
    "Place 5 cups of the frozen watermelon cubes in a blender. Blend on low to crush some of the watermelon cubes. (It’s OK if they aren’t uniformly crushed.) Add 3/4 cup rum, 1/3 cup lime juice, 1/4 simple syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Blend on low, raising the speed and pausing to stir if necessary, until thick and slushy in texture.",
    "Pour the mixture into 3 glasses and repeat with the remaining 5 cups watermelon, 3/4 cup rum, 1/3 cup lime juice, 1/4 cup simple syrup and 1/4 teaspoon salt to make a second batch.",
    "Serve the drinks cold, finished with an additional splash of rum if desired and garnished with lime wedges."
