  "instructions": [
    "Prehea oven to 350. Put the fillets in a mixing bowl, and add the parsley, garlic, rosemary, oil, wine, salt and pepper. Stir well.",
    "Trim off the root end of each leek. Split the leeks partly in half lengthwise, cutting to within an inch of the base. Rinse between each layer to wash away any sand. Cut the leeks crosswise into 2 1/2-inch lengths. Cut these pieces lengthwise into very thin julienne strips. There should be about 2 cups.",
    "Lay out a length of parchment paper or aluminum foil, measuring about 30 inches by 15 inches, on a baking sheet. Place the fish pieces and their sauce in the center of the paper or foil. Top the fish with the leeks. Fold over the edges of the paper or foil compactly, and seal the sides as tightly as possible. Place the baking sheet in the oven, and bake at 350 for 20 minutes or until the bag is well-puffed.",
    "Carefully open the bag - beware of the steam - and garnish the top of the dish with mussels, if desired."
