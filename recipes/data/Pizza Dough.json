    "Dissolve yeast in the warm water; stir in 1/2 teaspoon honey, and set aside to proof for 10 minutes.",
    "Mix remaining 2 1/2 teaspoons honey with the salt, olive oil and cool water and set aside.",
    "Put the flour in the bowl of a food processor. With processor running, slowly pour honey-oil mixture in through the feed tube. Then pour in the dissolved yeast. Process until dough forms a ball on blade. If it is too sticky, sprinkle on a little more flour.",
    "Transfer dough to a lightly floured surface and knead until smooth. Transfer to an oiled bowl and set aside to rest, covered, for 30 minutes.",
    "Divide dough into four equal parts. Roll each into a smooth, tight ball. Put on a flat sheet or dish, cover with a damp towel and refrigerate 1 to 3 hours.",
    "One hour before baking remove dough from refrigerator and let it come to room temperature before rolling and shaping."
