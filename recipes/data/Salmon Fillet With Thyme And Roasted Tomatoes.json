    "Preheat oven to 300 degrees. Slice the tomatoes very thin and place them on an oiled roasting dish. Roast for 30 minutes to an hour, or until they begin to shrivel and get brown around the edges. Remove from the oven, scrape up with a spatula and set aside. They will not hold their shape but this does not matter.",
    "Preheat broiler. Sprinkle the salmon fillet with the lemon juice and olive oil and season to taste. Broil for six minutes on each side or until the fish is done as you like it. Sprinkle with thyme and tomato pieces and serve."
