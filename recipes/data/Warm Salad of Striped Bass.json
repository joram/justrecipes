  "instructions": [
    "Trim the bass of the dark portion and any stray bones. Skin and cut into 1-inch cubes. In a 2-quart saucepan, heat the wine to boiling over high heat, add the bass and reduce heat to medium. Poach the bass until it is white and firm but still juicy, 3 to 4 minutes, turning pieces to cook evenly and watching carefully so the fish does not overcook. Timing is important.",
    "Drain the bass in a colander and place in a bowl. Break the fish apart into lump-crab-meat size pieces with a fork. Add 1/4 cup oil and toss to coat, adding more oil if necessary. Add the lemon juice and toss; season with salt and pepper. Fold in the cilantro. Divide among 4 plates and garnish each with olives. Serve while still warm."
