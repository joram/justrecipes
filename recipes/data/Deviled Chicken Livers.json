    "Preheat the oven to high (500 to 525 degrees).",
    "Cut away the connecting stringlike membranes from the livers. If the livers are large, cut them into four pieces of more or less equal size. If they are small, cut them in half. There should be 16 pieces.",
    "Place the pieces in a small bowl and add the scallions, shallots, mustard and cayenne pepper. Stir to blend.",
    "Wrap each condiment-coated piece of liver with one-half slice of bacon and secure the bacon with a toothpick.",
    "Arrange the wrapped livers on a rack and place in the oven. Bake eight to 12 minutes or until bacon is crisp. Drain on paper towels and serve immediately."
