    "Halve and pit 2 ripe avocados and scoop the flesh into a mixing bowl.",
    "Mash the avocados with a fork until the mixture reaches a coarse, chunky consistency. Stir in the remaining ingredients: 1 onion, minced, 1 garlic clove, minced and mashed to a paste with ½ tsp. salt, an additional ½ tsp. salt, 4 tsp. lime juice, ½ tsp. ground cumin, 1 jalapeño, seeded and minced, and 3 tablespoons chopped fresh cilantro, if using. Taste and adjust seasoning.\nDo Ahead: This guacamole recipe can be made two hours in advance. Press plastic wrap flush with the surface of the dip to prevent oxidation. Let it come to room temperature before serving.\n\n\nEditor’s note: This recipe was first printed in the December 1990 issue of ‘Gourmet.’ Head this way for tips on preventing guacamole from turning brown →"
