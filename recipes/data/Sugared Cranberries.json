    "Combine 1 cup water and 1 cup/200 grams sugar in a saucepan. Cook over medium-high until the sugar dissolves and the mixture comes to a simmer around the edges. Cool the syrup to room temperature.",
    "When the syrup is cool, add the cranberries and stir to coat. Work in batches if necessary. Use a slotted spoon to remove the cranberries from the syrup and place them on a cooling rack set over a sheet pan to drain. Let the cranberries dry for 45 minutes. Save the syrup for cocktails or another batch of cranberries.",
    "Pour the remaining 1 1/2 cups/250 grams sugar into a shallow dish and roll the cranberries, a few at a time, in the sugar until completely coated. Let them dry completely then store in an airtight container room temperature for up to 3 days. After a few days they may start to soften and weep a bit. Cook them down into sauce or quick jam."
