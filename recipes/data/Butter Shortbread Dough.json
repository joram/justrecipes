    "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the butter, salt and sugar. Beat on low speed until incorporated and smooth, scraping down the sides of the bowl as needed, about 3 minutes. (Do not beat until fluffy, you don’t need to incorporate air into the dough.) Add the yolks and mix until just combined. Turn the mixer off and scrape down the sides of the bowl. ",
    "Add the flour to the bowl all at once and scrape the bottom and sides of the bowl. Turn the mixer speed to low and beat until flour is fully incorporated, scraping the bowl again if needed, about 30 seconds. The dough will be in large crumbles. Wrap and refrigerate for later use, or divide the crumbles in half and proceed with <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023712-sparkling-shortbread-cookies\">Sparkling Shortbread Cookies</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023713-strawberry-jam-bars-with-cardamom\">Strawberry Jam Bars With Cardamom</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023714-spiced-chocolate-marble-shortbread\">Spiced Chocolate Marble Shortbread</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023715-cheddar-chive-crisps\">Cheddar Chive Crisps</a>, <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023717-salted-caramel-and-peanut-butter-shortbread\">Salted Caramel and Peanut Butter Shortbread</a> or <a href=\"https://cooking.nytimes.com/recipes/1023716-peppermint-patty-shortbreads\">Peppermint Patty Shortbreads</a>."
