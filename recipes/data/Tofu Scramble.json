    "Cut the block of tofu in half horizontally as you would a hamburger bun. Pat both pieces dry and wrap in paper towels. If time allows, press the tofu by placing a cast-iron skillet or other heavy object on top of the wrapped tofu for about 30 minutes. (This helps remove moisture so the tofu retains its shape better during cooking.)",
    "In a measuring cup or bowl, combine the soy sauce, turmeric and cumin with 2 tablespoons water.",
    "Unwrap the tofu and season on all sides with salt and pepper. Heat the oil in a medium skillet over medium-high. Add the tofu blocks and cook until golden brown and crisp on the bottom, 3 to 4 minutes. Flip the tofu and cook until golden brown and crisp on the other side, another 3 to 4 minutes. If the tofu is emitting water, hold the tofu with a spatula and pour the water out of the pan.",
    "Lower the heat to medium. Using a spatula or wooden spoon, break up the tofu into chunks. Add the scallions and the seasoning mixture and cook, stirring and continuing to break up the tofu, until absorbed, about 2 minutes. Serve immediately."
