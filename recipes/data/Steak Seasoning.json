  "instructions": [
    "Add the salt, black pepper, paprika, garlic powder, ground coriander and dried dill to a small resealable container, cover and shake to combine. (The steak seasoning will keep in an airtight container for up to 6 months in a dark place.) ",
    "To use, pat the steak seasoning into the steak in a thin layer. You should still be able to see the meat through the seasoning; if you add excess seasoning, it may simply fall off and burn during cooking. (You can season and refrigerate the steaks, uncovered, up to 24 hours ahead.) ",
    "Grease your skillet or grill with neutral oil and cook as desired, reducing heat as necessary to prevent spices from burning."
