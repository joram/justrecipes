    "Heat oven to 500 degrees. Loosen skin of chicken and insert a pat or two of butter, depending on size of chicken pieces, and a portion of herbs under skin. Sprinkle skin with salt and pepper and place pieces, skin side up, in a roasting pan just large enough to accommodate chicken.",
    "Roast, turning pan from front to back once after 15 minutes. (Do not turn pieces.) Chicken is usually done when nicely browned, 10 to 15 minutes later (about 30 minutes total), but you can cut into a piece or two to make sure juices are running clear. Serve hot or warm, with lemon wedges."
