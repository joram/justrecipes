  "instructions": [
    "Trim roots and outside leaves from scallions, halve or quarter them lengthwise, then cut them in 2-inch lengths. Set aside.",
    "Bring the water to a boil and add noodles and boil until they are just tender, 6 to 8 minutes. Drain and rinse them well under cold running water to remove surface starch.",
    "In a separate saucepan, heat the dashi or stock to a simmer. Add soy sauces, sugar, rice wine and salt. Simmer 5 minutes. Add chicken pieces and simmer about 10 minutes, skimming off any foam. Add scallions and cook 1 minute longer.",
    "Reheat noodles by placing them in a sieve and immersing them in a pot of boiling water for 1 minute. Drain and divide the noodles among four deep bowls. Reheat broth and ladle it with the chicken and scallions over the noodles. Serve at once with pepper on the side."
