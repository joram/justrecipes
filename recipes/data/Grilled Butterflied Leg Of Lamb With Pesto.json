  "instructions": [
    "Place lamb in roasting pan. Mix olive oil, lemon juice, garlic, salt and pepper together and pour over lamb. Turn lamb in the pan several times to coat it with the mixture and allow it to marinate several hours at room temperature. Turn occasionally.",
    "Preheat broiler. Broil the lamb (in the same pan) 10 minutes on one side and 10 minutes on the other, adding a little water to the pan from time to time to keep the bottom from scorching. Remove the pan from the broiler and brush the lamb on both sides with pesto.",
    "Before returning the pan to the broiler, insert a meat thermometer. Continue broiling until the thermometer reads 140 degrees.",
    "When lamb is done, remove the pan from the broiler. Brush the serving platter with a little pesto, place the lamb on it and sprinkle the lamb with lemon juice and salt to taste. Let rest in a warm place 5 minutes, slice thin and serve with some of the juices in the platter."
