  "instructions": [
    "Pat fillets dry and season on both sides with salt and pepper.",
    "Heat a large (12-inch) nonstick skillet over high. When the pan is hot, add the oil. Working in batches, if necessary, cook the fillets skin-side down. (To prevent splattering, lay the portion of the fillet closest to you into the pan first, so that any oil will splatter in the direction away from you as you set down the rest of the fillet.) Press down on the fish with a spatula for 20 seconds, then lower heat to medium and cook until golden, 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "Carefully flip fillets and cook until cooked through, about 90 seconds. (Time will vary depending on the thickness of the fish.) Add additional oil if needed for a second batch.",
    "Transfer the fish to a cutting board. Remove the skin if desired, then break the fish into bite-size chunks with a knife or fork. Transfer to a serving bowl and stir in the fish sauce and sugar. Set aside to cool slightly.",
    "While the fish cools, make the toasted rice powder, if using raw jasmine rice: Wipe out the skillet and return it to medium heat. Toast the rice, stirring frequently, until it starts to smell nutty and turns golden, 4 to 5 minutes. Transfer to a mortar and pestle or spice grinder, cool slightly, then process into a powder.",
    "Add the red onion and red-pepper flakes to the fish and stir gently. Add the cilantro, mint, scallions and lime juice and stir gently to combine. Sprinkle with the toasted rice powder and season to taste with more fish sauce and lime juice as needed."
