    "In a shaker, combine the scotch, blanc vermouth, amaro and lemon juice. Add ice, cover and shake vigorously until the drink is well chilled, about 15 seconds. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass. Holding a lemon peel by its long edges, skin facing down into the glass, pinch the peel to release the citrus oils. Add it to the glass and serve."
