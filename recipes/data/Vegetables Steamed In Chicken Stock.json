  "instructions": [
    "Place 3/4 cup of the glaze in the bottom of a large, wide pot over medium heat. Add the vegetables and bring the liquid to a boil. Reduce heat so liquid slowly simmers. Cover and cook until vegetables are tender, about 25 minutes, adding water if necessary to keep liquid in the bottom of the pot at all times.",
    "Preheat broiler. Transfer the vegetables to a 9-inch pie plate. Spoon the remaining glaze over the top and season with the salt and pepper to taste. Place under the broiler until the top is lightly browned. Divide the vegetables among 4 plates and serve immediately."
