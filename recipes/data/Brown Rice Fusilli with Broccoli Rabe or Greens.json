  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil. Trim off the bottoms of the broccoli raab stems and slice the remaining part of the stems about 1/2 inch thick. When the water comes to a boil, season generously with salt and add the broccoli raab. Cook for 4 minutes, or until tender, and transfer using a spider or a slotted spoon to a bowl of ice cold water. Let sit for a few minutes and drain. Squeeze out water and chop fine. Set aside the water for the pasta.",
    "Heat the oil over medium heat in a large nonstick skillet and add the garlic and red pepper flakes. Cook until the garlic smells fragrant, 30 seconds to a minute, and add the broccoli raab. Toss together for a minute, season to taste with salt, and remove from the heat but keep warm.",
    "Bring the water back to a boil and add the fusilli. Cook al dente, about 9 minutes. Stir 1/2 cup of the pasta water into the greens. Drain and toss the pasta with the greens and cheese. Serve at once."
