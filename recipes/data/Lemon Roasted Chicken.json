    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Using a vegetable peeler, remove the zest from 1 lemon in long, thin strips. Loosen the skin over the chicken breasts and place the zest between the skin and the meat. Cut all the lemons in half lengthwise and then across into 3/4-inch-thick slices. Squeeze the juice from 1 of the slices over the skin of the chicken.",
    "Season with salt and pepper. Stuff half of the lemon slices and half of the onions into the cavity of the chicken. Place the rest in the center of a roasting pan and place the chicken on top of them. Roast for 15 minutes. Lower oven temperature to 375 degrees. Continue roasting until the juices run clear when pricked with a fork in the thickest part of the leg, about 1 hour and 15 minutes longer. Let stand for 10 minutes. Carve, divide among 4 plates and serve."
