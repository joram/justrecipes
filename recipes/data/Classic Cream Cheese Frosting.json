    "Using an electric mixer on medium-high speed, beat cream cheese and butter in a medium bowl until smooth, about 1 minute. Beat in vanilla bean paste and salt. Reduce mixer speed to low and gradually beat in powdered sugar. Increase speed to high and continue to beat until light and fluffy, about 2 minutes.\nDo Ahead: Frosting can be made 5 days ahead; chill, or freeze up to 1 month. Bring to room temperature, then beat with electric mixer on medium speed until smooth. If texture is not smooth, beat in water 1 tsp. at a time. \n\nEditor’s note: This recipe first appeared on Epicurious in March 2017. Head this way for a different style of cream cheese frosting that some people call magic →"
