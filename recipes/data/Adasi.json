  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oil in a large Dutch oven or pot over medium until shimmering. Add the onions, season with salt and cook, stirring occasionally, until they start to soften and become light golden, about 6 minutes.",
    "Add the cumin and turmeric and stir until fragrant, about 30 seconds. Stir in the lentils, then 5 cups water; season with salt. Increase the heat to bring it to a boil.",
    "Once it comes to a boil, give it stir, then reduce heat to low to maintain a simmer. Cover and let cook until the lentils are tender and creamy without a firm bite, about 1 hour and 15 minutes. (For ultimate creaminess, cook it on low for up to three hours, stirring every hour or so.)",
    "Remove the lid, stir and let any remaining water cook off, 5 to 10 minutes more, stirring occasionally to make sure nothing sticks to the bottom. Use a wooden spoon to mash some of the lentils against the side of the pan to thicken the soup, if desired. Season to taste with salt.",
    "Spoon into bowls, squeeze the juice of 1 lime wedge into each, drizzle with olive oil, then add a pinch of oregano or herbs, if using, and serve."
