    "In a small bowl, stir together the garlic, salt, pepper and rosemary. Spread the paste all over the meat. Cover loosely with plastic wrap and refrigerate at least 3 hours or overnight.",
    "When you are ready to prepare the meat, remove it from the fridge and let stand at room temperature for 30 to 60 minutes.",
    "Heat oven to 325 degrees. Place a wire rack in a rimmed baking sheet.",
    "Coat the roast lightly with olive oil. Transfer to the wire rack and roast for 75 to 95 minutes, until an instant thermometer inserted into the center of the roast registers 125 to 130 degrees for medium-rare.",
    "Transfer the meat to a cutting board and let cool completely before carving (trim off the fat cap if you plan to serve it cold). The meat can be roasted three days ahead; cool completely before refrigerating."
