    "Preheat the oven to 400°F. Line a half sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "In a medium skillet, heat 2 tablespoons of the butter over medium heat. Add the apples and cook, stirring often, until softened and lightly caramelized, 10 to 12 minutes. Transfer the apples to a bowl and toss with the honey. Season with salt and pepper.In a small saucepan, melt the remaining 6 tablespoons butter. On the prepared sheet pan, lay out 1 sheet of the phyllo dough and lightly brush it with melted butter to coat. Lay another sheet of phyllo on top, brush with butter, and repeat this process until you’ve layered all 6 sheets of phyllo. Place the Brie in the center and top it with the apple mixture. Fold the corners of the phyllo sheets toward the center of the Brie, overlapping them to seal, then brush with any remaining melted butter.",
