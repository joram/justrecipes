    "Combine sugar and water in a heavy-bottom saucepan made of stainless steel, aluminum, copper or unchipped agate. Start cooking over low heat. If any syrup spatters onto the inside of the saucepan, use a brush dipped in cold water to wipe it away. This will prevent the syrup from crystallizing when it has finished cooking.",
    "Once syrup is boiling, add lemon juice. Continue cooking until syrup has a clear dark-amber or caramel color. It should register about 248 degrees on a thermometer used for candy. It will take about 20 minutes for the syrup to start to boil."
