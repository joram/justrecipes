    "Using scissors, cut each slice of bacon in half crosswise at a diagonal, like cutting ribbon. (This will help secure the bacon to the date.) Starting at the straight end of the bacon, roll the bacon around the dates. Tuck the point under the wrapped bacon to secure. Place seam side down on a baking sheet.",
    "Place in the oven, and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Cook for 10 minutes, then flip and cook until golden brown all over, another 5 to 15 minutes, depending on the thickness of your bacon.",
    "Season with black pepper (if desired), then transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to crisp and cool slightly."
