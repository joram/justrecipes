  "instructions": [
    "Arrange a rack at the bottom of the oven and heat to 425 degrees. On a sheet pan, toss the squash with the oil and salt; spread into an even layer. Roast the squash on the bottom rack until golden-brown and the pieces release easily from the pan, 25 to 30 minutes. Stir (and add any ground spices if you like), spread into an even layer, and cook until tender, another 5 to 10 minutes. Let cool slightly on the sheet pan before eating."
