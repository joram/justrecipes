    "Melt the butter in a large saucepan and mix in the sugar. Add the peaches and cook over high heat until the peach wedges soften and begin to render juice and the juices begin to thicken and caramelize, about 5 to 6 minutes. Add the lemon juice and peach preserves and cook an additional 2 to 3 minutes.",
    "In your kitchen or at the table, add the rum and ignite, burning the alcohol for about 1 minute. Divide the dessert among six serving dishes and serve as is or with a scoop of ice cream in the center."
