    "In a small bowl, whisk together vinegar, oil, miso and honey. Season with a pinch of salt (miso is salty, so don’t overdo it) and a few grinds of black pepper.",
    "Roughly chop any long pieces of cabbage so they are bite-size. Transfer cabbage to a large bowl and toss with half the dressing, adding more as you like. Slaw can be made up to this point up to 1 day ahead.",
    "Just before serving, add cilantro, peanuts and lime juice, and toss to combine."
