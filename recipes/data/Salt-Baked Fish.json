  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 400 degrees. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper.",
    "Blot the fish dry with a paper towel. Lightly brush both sides and the cavities of fish with olive oil.",
    "Slice 1 lemon into thin rounds and the second lemon into wedges. Place the lemon rounds and fresh herbs inside the fish.",
    "In a large bowl, stir the salt with 1/2 cup cold water, adding more water as needed. You want the salt to feel like damp (not wet) sand.",
    "Create a salt bed (or beds) for your fish. Scoop about half the salt onto the baking sheet and pat it into an even 1/2-inch-thick bed (or 2 separate beds) on which to lay the fish. Place the fish on top and use your hands to pat the remaining salt all around the fish so everything is enclosed and sealed. You may need to make more of the salt mixture. The goal is to have a thick crust that completely encloses the fish so it can steam inside.",
    "Find the thickest part of the fish (usually near the head) and use an instant read thermometer to poke a hole through the salt crust to touch the top of the fish. This is so you can take its temperature with cracking the crust.",
    "Bake for 18 to 25 minutes for 2 small fish, and 30 to 40 minutes for a large fish. The fish is done when its internal temperature reaches 135 degrees (use the hole you made to insert the thermometer to check). Take fish out of the oven and let rest for 5 to 10 minutes.",
    "Using a butter knife or offset spatula, crack open the crust, removing it entirely from the top of the fish and discard salt. Then peel off and discard the skin on top (itâ€™s too salty to eat). Using a spoon or spatula, carefully remove the fish flesh from the bones (and poke out fish cheeks if you like). Lift the fish skeleton, lemons and herbs, and remove, then scoop out bottom fillets, taking care not to puncture the skin.",
    "Drizzle fish fillets with olive oil, sprinkle with smoked paprika or chile flakes, if you like, and serve with lemon wedges."
