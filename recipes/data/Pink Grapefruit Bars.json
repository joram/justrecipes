  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: Heat oven to 325 degrees. Coat a 9-by-13-inch baking pan with nonstick cooking spray and line with a strip of parchment paper that hangs over the long sides by about 2 inches to create a sling.",
    "In a large bowl, combine the flour, granulated sugar and salt. Add the melted butter and vanilla extract and stir until a moist, crumbly dough forms. Transfer the dough into the prepared baking pan and press into an even layer using your hands or the bottom of a measuring cup. Prick the top of the dough all over with a fork and bake until the crust is deep golden brown in the center and slightly puffed, 40 to 45 minutes. Immediately use the bottom of a measuring cup or a flat metal spatula to press down the hot crust to compact it slightly. (This will help prevent the crust from crumbling when you cut it.)",
    "While the crust is baking, prepare the grapefruit layer: Combine the granulated sugar and grapefruit zest in a large bowl and massage the zest into the sugar until very fragrant. Add the flour and whisk to incorporate it. Add the eggs, grapefruit juice, vanilla extract and salt; whisk until no streaks of unincorporated egg remain.",
    "As soon as the crust comes out of the oven, pour the grapefruit mixture through a fine-mesh strainer directly on top of the hot crust, using a spatula to press it through. Discard the zest that’s left in the strainer, then bake the bars until the edges are completely set but the center jiggles ever so slightly when moved, 28 to 34 minutes. Set the bars in the baking pan on a wire rack at room temperature until completely cooled, about 1 hour, then chill in the refrigerator, uncovered, until completely cold and firm, at least 6 hours, but preferably overnight.",
    "While the bars are chilling, make the pink dusting, if desired: In the bowl of a food processor or in a blender, combine the freeze-dried strawberries and confectioners’ sugar. Process until the mixture has the texture of very fine dust, 20 to 30 seconds.",
    "Once the bars are cool, run a thin offset spatula or knife around the edges to help loosen them then, using the parchment paper, lift the bars out of the pan and transfer onto a cutting board. Dust the top of the bars with a generous, even layer of the pink dusting or plain confectioners’ sugar. (You might not need all of the pink dusting.)",
    "Cut the bars into a 4-by-6 grid to make 24 squares, wiping your knife with a damp cloth between each cut, and serve immediately. Store leftover bars, in an airtight container in a single layer, in the fridge for up to 5 days. If desired, dust again before serving."
