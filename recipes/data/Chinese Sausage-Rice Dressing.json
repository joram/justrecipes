  "instructions": [
    "Place the sweet and short-grain rice in a sieve and wash under running water for 3 minutes. Transfer to a bowl and cover with water. Soak for 15 minutes. Drain and place the rice in a large pot. Add 3 cups of water and bring to a boil over high heat. Cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Simmer for about 15 to 18 minutes, until the water is absorbed and the rice is cooked but not too mushy.",
    "Cut the sausages in half lengthwise, then on the diagonal into 1-inch slices. Heat the oil in a wok or large skillet and saute the sausage slices for 5 minutes. Add the onions and saute 5 minutes. Add the celery and cook 5 minutes. Stir in the scallions and water chestnuts and remove from the heat.",
    "Transfer the rice to a large bowl and stir in the sausage mixture. Mix well; the rice will be very dense, so the mixing will require some effort. Drizzle in the soy sauce, blending well. Serve hot with the turkey. (This dressing makes terrific leftovers when fried the next day.)"
