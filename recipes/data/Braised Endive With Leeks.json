  "instructions": [
    "Preheat oven to 325 degrees.",
    "Rinse the endive but leave the heads whole. Slice the leeks, trimming the roots and withered leaves. Rinse them thoroughly in several changes of cold water, making sure you have removed all the grit. Do not worry if the slices come apart.",
    "Place the sliced leeks across the bottom of a buttered shallow baking dish just big enough to hold the endive in one layer (use two dishes if necessary). Arrange the endive on top and add the butter, cut into pieces, and the chicken stock. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "Cover with wax or foil paper and bake until the endive is tender (about 30 or 40 minutes) and the liquid has reduced to a syrupy glaze. (Remove the paper during cooking, about halfway through, if necessary to reduce the liquid).",
    "Sprinkle with chervil or parsley and serve."
