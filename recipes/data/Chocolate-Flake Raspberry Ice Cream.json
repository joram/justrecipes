  "instructions": [
    "Make the chocolate flake and topping: Mix together the chocolate and oil in a heatproof bowl fitted over a saucepan of simmering water. Gently heat and stir until the chocolate is melted and the mixture is glossy and smooth. Set aside 1/2 cup to use as the flake and the rest for the topping. You can make the flake and topping up to 5 days ahead and keep it covered in the refrigerator. Warm to melt before using.",
    "Make the ice cream: Working with a stand or immersion blender, blend all the ingredients, scraping the container occasionally, until smooth. (Pay attention to the powdered milk; it has a pesky way of clumping.) Cover, and refrigerate the mixture for up to 1 day, or churn right away. When you’re ready, pour the mixture into the ice cream maker and churn according to the manufacturer’s directions.",
    "Just before the ice cream is ready, open the top of the machine and, with the blade spinning, gradually drizzle in the reserved 1/2 cup of warmed chocolate flake. Churn for another 1 or 2 minutes to fully incorporate the flakes. Pack the ice cream into a container, cover and freeze for at least 6 hours before serving.",
    "Once the ice cream is ready to serve, take the container out 5 minutes before scooping. (Its texture is best after it’s had a few minutes on the counter.) Rewarm the remaining chocolate topping, and pour it over the individual servings of ice cream. It will immediately harden into a chocolate shell."
