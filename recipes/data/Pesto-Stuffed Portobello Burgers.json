  "instructions": [
    "Carefully remove the stems from the portobellos and scoop out the gills using a spoon. In a large bowl, toss the portobellos with 2 tablespoons olive oil, salt, pepper, crushed garlic and chopped basil. Marinate for 30 minutes.",
    "Heat remaining oil in a large, heavy skillet over medium-high heat. Add the portobellos (in batches if necessary), rounded side down, and cook 7 minutes. Flip the mushrooms over and cook another 5 to 7 minutes. The mushrooms should be releasing liquid. Flip over again so the cavity is up, and spread a heaped tablespoon of pesto in each cavity. Cook another 2 minutes, until the mushrooms are tender and juicy and the pesto is warm. The mushrooms will release more liquid into the pan, then the liquid will evaporate. Serve on hamburger buns if desired."
