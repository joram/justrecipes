    "In a large bowl or spouted measuring cup, blend or whisk the half-and-half into the sweetened, condensed coconut milk. Add the remaining ingredients and 1/2 cup water and whisk to combine. Pour into small disposable cups and freeze for at least 4 hours, until frozen. (For smaller servings, pour into an ice tray.)",
    "To serve, squeeze the cup to push the limber up, and eat it directly from the cup. You could also pull it out of the cup and flip it, so the base becomes the top, and eat."
