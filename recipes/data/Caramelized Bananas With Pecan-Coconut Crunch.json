  "instructions": [
    "Make the crunchy topping: In a large skillet, heat 2 tablespoons butter over medium until melted and foamy, about 3 minutes. Add 1 tablespoon honey and the salt; using a spatula, stir to combine. Add the pecans, pumpkin seeds, oats and coconut and stir to coat. Toast, stirring frequently, until the mixture is golden brown, about 8 minutes, lowering the heat as necessary to keep the mixture from burning. Stir in the sesame seeds and remove from heat. Move to a shallow bowl and set aside to cool. (You should have about 1 1/2 cups.)",
    "Prepare the bananas: Set the oven to broil. Wipe out the skillet and add the brown sugar, heavy cream, nutmeg, pepper, remaining 2 tablespoons butter and 1 tablespoon honey. Stir ingredients and bring to a simmer over medium heat until the sugar is dissolved, about 2 minutes.",
    "Remove the skillet from the heat and place the bananas in the pan, cut-side up. Spoon some of the sauce over the top to coat the slices. Move the pan to the oven and broil until the caramel sauce is hot and bubbly and the bananas are tender, deep golden and slightly charred in spots, 7 to 10 minutes. Remove from oven and allow to sit for at least 5 minutes.",
    "Spoon a large helping of the ice cream, whipped cream or crème fraîche over the warm bananas, then scatter the pecan-coconut crunch over the top. Divide among individual plates or eat directly from the skillet."
