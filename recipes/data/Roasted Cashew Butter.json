    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Spread nuts in an even layer on a rimmed baking sheet. Bake until golden and nicely toasted, about 20 minutes, stirring halfway through. Transfer to a rack and cool completely, 30 minutes.",
    "Place nuts in a food processor and pur√©e until smooth, about 8 minutes, scraping the sides and bottom of the bowl as needed (mixture may clump up, but will eventually become creamy). Season to taste with salt, if desired. Cashew butter will keep in an airtight container in the refrigerator for at least 3 weeks."
