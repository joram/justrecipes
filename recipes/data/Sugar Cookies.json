    "In a medium bowl, whisk the flour, baking powder and salt to combine. Set aside.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer with the paddle attachment, beat the butter and sugar on medium-high, scraping down the sides as needed, until the mixture is light and fluffy, 2 to 3 minutes. Add the egg and vanilla, and beat on medium, scraping down the sides with a spatula, until well combined, about 30 seconds. (Alternatively, this can also be done in a large bowl with an electric hand mixer.)",
    "Add the dry ingredients to the wet ingredients and mix on low until just incorporated. Use a wooden spoon or spatula to give the batter one last stir and incorporate the flour from the bottom of the bowl. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and chill in the fridge for at least 1 hour and up to 24 hours.",
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees, placing one rack in the top third of the oven and another in the bottom third. Line 2 baking sheets with parchment paper.",
    "Remove the dough from the fridge. Scoop out 1 heaping tablespoon (about 25 grams) of dough, roll into a ball and place on the prepared baking sheets, continuing with the remaining dough and setting the balls about 3 inches apart. Using the palm of your hand, gently press down on the balls to flatten them to 2-inch rounds.",
    "Bake until the edges and undersides are lightly golden but the centers are still soft, 8 to 10 minutes, switching the rack positions and rotating the baking sheets halfway. Remove from the oven and allow cookies to cool on the baking sheets for 5 minutes. Transfer the cookies to a rack to cool completely, then transfer to an airtight container to keep at room temperature for 2 to 3 days, or up to 1 week in the fridge."
