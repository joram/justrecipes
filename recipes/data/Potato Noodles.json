  "instructions": [
    "Cut potato in quarters, place in a pot with water to cover, bring to a boil over high heat and cook until tender, about 15 minutes. Drain and mash until smooth in a large bowl. Allow it to cool to lukewarm. Stir in the egg and half the salt. Mix in enough flour to make a soft dough that’s not sticky. Spread more flour on a board and transfer dough to the board. Knead lightly for a minute or two. Roll or pat into a rectangle that’s about 1/4-inch thick.",
    "Mix onion with remaining teaspoon salt and spread in a large, heavy skillet. Cover and place over low heat to steam until tender but not brown, 5 to 8 minutes. Set aside.",
    "Bring a large pot of salted water to a boil. Slice dough into 1/4-inch wide strips and cut into 1-inch-long pieces. Drop into boiling water, reduce heat to medium, and cook until noodles rise to the surface, 1 to 3 minutes. Drain and toss with 1 tablespoon of the butter. Keep covered.",
    "Add remaining butter to the skillet with the onions. Cook on medium until the butter melts, toss, add bread crumbs and dill and cook for a few minutes until ingredients are well-combined and the bread crumbs are fragrant. Add noodles, reheat and gently fold everything together and serve."
