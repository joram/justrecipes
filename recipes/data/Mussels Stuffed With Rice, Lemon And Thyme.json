    "Steam the mussels (see recipe). Measure the broth and add enough water to make 1 cup. Place this liquid in a small saucepan and bring to a boil. Add the rice, reduce the heat so the liquid simmers slowly, cover and cook until the liquid is absorbed, about 15 minutes. Place the rice in a bowl.",
    "Preheat a broiler. Remove the mussels from the shells. Separate 20 half-shells and wash them. Coarsely chop the mussels and add them to the rice. Stir in the thyme, lemon rind, salt and pepper. Divide the mixture among the cleaned mussel shells. Place the stuffed mussels under the broiler until hot, about 3 minutes. Sprinkle with parsley and serve immediately."
