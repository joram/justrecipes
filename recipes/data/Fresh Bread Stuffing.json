  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Tear bread into chunks, and put them in the container of a food processor; you may need to do this in batches. Pulse until you have coarse, irregular crumbs, no smaller than a pea and preferably larger.",
    "Melt butter over medium heat in a large, deep skillet, Dutch oven or casserole. Add scallions, and cook, stirring occasionally, until they soften, about 5 minutes. Add nuts and cook, stirring almost constantly, until they begin to brown, about 3 minutes.",
    "Add bread crumbs and tarragon or sage, and toss to mix. Turn heat to low, and add parsley, along with some salt and pepper; taste and adjust seasoning if necessary.",
    "Bake stuffing in same pan, or put in an ovenproof casserole. Bake 30 minutes, or until stuffing is lightly browned on top. Serve hot. (Stuffing may also be cooked in turkey, if desired.)"
