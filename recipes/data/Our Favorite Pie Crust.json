  "instructions": [
    "In a food processor, pulse 2½ cups (313 g) all-purpose flour, 4½ tsp. granulated sugar, and 1 tsp. Diamond Crystal or ½ tsp. Morton kosher salt. Add 1 cup (2 sticks) unsalted butter, cut into small pieces, frozen for 15 minutes, to dry ingredients and pulse until coarse, pea-sized crumbs appear, about 10 seconds. With the motor running, add 1 Tbsp. apple cider vinegar, chilled, and ¼ cup ice-cold water and process until the dough just holds together, about 30 seconds. Squeeze a small amount of dough between your fingers and if it is very crumbly, add more ice water, 1 Tbsp. at a time (2 Tbsp. maximum). Do not overprocess.",
    "Turn dough out onto a lightly floured surface and push together into a rough ball. Knead a few times to combine, then divide into two equal balls. Flatten each ball into a disk with smooth edges (no cracks), cover with plastic wrap, and refrigerate at least 1 hour or up to overnight.\nDo ahead: Pie dough can be made 3 months ahead; keep wrapped and freeze. Thaw before using. \n\nEditor’s note: This recipe was first printed in November 2014 as ‘Our Favorite Pie Dough.’ Head this way for a tutorial on blind baking, or over here for all of our best pie recipes →"
