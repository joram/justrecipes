  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 425 degrees. Meanwhile, bring 1 cup water to a boil in a medium saucepan. Once boiling, add the butter beans and return to a boil. Reduce the heat and simmer, covered, until the beans are al dente, about 8 minutes. Remove from heat, strain, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Set aside.",
    "While the butter beans are cooking, prepare the okra: Spread the okra in an even layer on a lined baking sheet. Drizzle with 1 teaspoon olive oil, and sprinkle with 1/4 teaspoon kosher salt. Roast the okra for 16 to 18 minutes. Remove from the oven and set aside.",
    "Heat a large cast-iron skillet or Dutch oven over medium. Add the andouille sausage and cook until it’s crisp and the fat has rendered. Remove the sausage with a slotted spoon and set aside.",
    "Add the onion, bell pepper and garlic to the rendered fat in the skillet or Dutch oven, and cook until the vegetables are softened, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the corn, tomatoes, lima beans, okra, 1 teaspoon kosher salt, 1/2 teaspoon black pepper and andouille sausage. Stir, cover, and cook for about 8 minutes over medium heat.",
    "As vegetables cook, pat the shrimp dry with paper towels, then generously season with 1/2 teaspoon salt and 1/4 teaspoon black pepper.",
    "In a separate large (12-inch) skillet, heat the remaining 1 tablespoon of olive oil over medium-high. Once the oil is shimmering, add the shrimp in a single layer. Cook for 2 minutes, then flip and cook for another 2 to 3 minutes, until pink and cooked through. Stir the cooked shrimp into the succotash.",
    "Add the fresh basil and stir. Taste, and adjust seasoning as needed. Turn off heat and let sit uncovered for about 5 minutes to let the flavors meld. Serve warm."
