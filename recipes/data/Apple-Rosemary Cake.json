    "Preheat oven to 350 degrees. Brush one-half tablespoon of the butter in six-cup loaf pan. Dust with tablespoon of sugar.",
    "Place the eggs in the bowl of electric mixer. Add the remaining sugar, beat to combine, then beat over high speed, with a wire whisk attachment, if possible, until mixture is very light and the consistency of softly whipped cream, at least five minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, sift the flour and baking powder together and set aside.",
    "When the eggs and sugar have been whipped sufficiently, fold in the flour mixture by hand, then fold in the diced apple, rosemary, orange extract and remaining melted butter.",
    "Pour the batter into the prepared pan, smooth the top and bake 40 to 45 minutes, until the cake has risen, is evenly browned and a cake tester comes out clean. Allow to cool briefly on a rack, then unmold to permit them to complete their cooling."
