  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt it. Plunge the lobsters into the water (one or two at a time if necessary) and cook just until they turn red, about 2 minutes. Remove them and plunge into an ice-water bath to stop the cooking. (You can do this several hours in advance and refrigerate the lobsters until you're ready to proceed.) Split the tails down the middle of their soft undersides so they will lie flat.",
    "Preheat broiler, and adjust the rack so there will be about 3 inches between the lobsters and the heating element. Broil the lobsters until they are hot and their shells just begin to char, about 10 minutes. Serve hot, warm, at room temperature or cold, with the vinaigrette."
