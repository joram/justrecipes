    "Remove the stalks and feathery leaves from the fennel bulbs. Mince two tablespoons of the leaves and set aside. Chop the bulbs. You should have about two cups of the chopped bulbs. If additional fennel is needed, chop some of the stalks. Discard any unused stalks.",
    "Heat the oil in a heavy four-quart saucepan. Add the onion and chopped fennel bulbs and cook slowly, covered, until they are soft and transparent.",
    "Add the stock, bring to a simmer, and stir in the potatoes and cumin. Simmer partly covered until the vegetables are very tender, about 30 minutes.",
    "While the vegetables are simmering, steam the lobster for 10 minutes, allow it to cool briefly, then remove the meat from the tail and claws. Dice the meat and refrigerate it, covered, until ready to serve.",
    "When the vegetables are tender, allow them to cool briefly, then puree in a blender in batches. Puree the soup in a food processor, if you prefer. It will not be as smooth and will benefit from being forced through a fine sieve. Refrigerate the puree, covered, at least four hours or overnight.",
    "Before serving, stir the half and half into the puree, using as much as you need to give the soup a creamy, but not too thick, consistency. If calories are a concern, the soup can be thinned with water. Add the Pernod and season the soup with salt and pepper. Ladle the soup into six shallow soup plates and spoon some of the lobster into the middle of each. Scatter the minced fennel leaves over the soup and serve."
