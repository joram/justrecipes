  "instructions": [
    "Cut the feta in 1/4-inch-thick slices, then cut each rectangular slice in half crosswise to form two squares. You should end up with about 16 squares. Transfer the squares to a paper towel on your cutting board and pat dry.",
    "In a large shallow bowl or rimmed plate, stir together the cornstarch and sesame seeds. Working with one at a time, gently coat the feta on both sides with the cornstarch mixture.",
    "In a large, nonstick skillet, melt the butter over medium heat. Add the feta in a single layer and cook until golden-brown, about 1 minute. Using a spatula, gently flip and cook until golden-brown on the other side. Transfer to a platter and sprinkle with flaky salt, black pepper and red-pepper flakes. Serve warm with crackers or toasted baguette slices, with lemon wedges alongside for squeezing on top."
