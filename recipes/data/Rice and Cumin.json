    "Heat the oil in a heavy saucepan with a lid. When the oil is hot, but not smoking, add the onions and saute them for 30 seconds.",
    "Add the garlic; then, stir in the rice and cumin. Stir well to coat the grains of rice with the oil, and then add the chicken stock or broth. Bring to a boil, uncovered, stirring occasionally, over high heat. Then, reduce the heat to low, cover, and cook for 20 minutes. The liquid should be completely absorbed by the rice, which should be tender.",
    "Fluff the rice with a fork and serve it with the cusk."
