    "Combine the canola oil and Sucanat in a heavy saucepan, and cook, stirring, over low heat, for about 3 minutes. Add the rice milk and stir well to combine. Add the cinnamon, nutmeg, and vanilla. Whisk well. Heat over medium-high heat, stirring often, until it begins to boil. Remove from the heat. Pour over the bread cubes in a shallow bowl, toss gently, and let soak for 30 minutes.",

    "Pour half of the bread mixture into the pan. Top with two-thirds of the banana slices. Cover with the remaining half of the bread mixture. Top with the remaining third of the sliced bananas. Sprinkle the Sucanat/cinnamon mixture evenly over the top. Dot with the shortening.",
    "Bake for 1 hour, or until caramelized and golden brown on top. Let cool before serving."
