    "Cut the lemons lengthwise in quarters, leaving them attached at one end. Rub the cut surfaces of the lemons with a little salt. Place 1 tablespoon of the salt in the bottom of a 1-quart glass jar. Layer the lemons in the jar alternately with the remaining salt, cardamom pods and peppercorns, pressing them with a wooden spoon as you put them in to release their juices. Pour in lemon juice to just cover the lemons.",
    "Cover the jar and refrigerate, shaking the jar daily for 2 to 3 weeks. To use, rinse the salt off the lemons, scrape out the pulp and cut into pieces. Preserved lemons will keep for months refrigerated. Add 1 or 2 to chicken-and-olive stews, couscous, tomato salads or lamb dishes."
