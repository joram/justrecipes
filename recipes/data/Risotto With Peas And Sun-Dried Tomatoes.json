  "instructions": [
    "Chop the sun-dried tomatoes. Bring the chicken or vegetable broth to simmer.",
    "Heat the butter in a large skillet and saute the scallions until they are soft. Add the rice and saute it, stirring, until it turns opaque.",
    "Add the wine and let it reduce. Add one-half cup of hot chicken stock and mix it in so the rice absorbs it. As the liquid is absorbed, add more. Season with salt and pepper to taste. Continue adding liquid and stirring for about 20 minutes all told, or until the rice is al dente.",
    "When the rice is almost cooked, add the peas and tomatoes and stir thoroughly. The liquid should be absorbed and the rice creamy. Stir in the cheese, cover for a minute or two and then serve with extra cheese passed separately."
