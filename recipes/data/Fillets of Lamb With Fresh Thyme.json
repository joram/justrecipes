  "instructions": [
    "In a cast iron skillet, heat the olive oil on high. Add lamb trimmings and bones, and brown well for about 5 minutes, stirring. Remove from heat, and drain off all fat. Add onions, and brown lightly. Add chicken broth and 2 sprigs of the thyme. Bring to a boil, and simmer for an hour. Strain through a fine sieve -- there should be about 1/3 cup. Keep warm.",
    "Meanwhile place carrots in a saucepan, cover with water and simmer for 1/2 hour. Carrots should be soft throughout. Drain, place in a blender and make a fine puree. Pass puree through a fine sieve. There should be about 3 tablespoons of puree.",
    "Blend puree with lamb broth over low heat. Remove, and set aside.",
    "Trim most of the fat from lamb fillets, leaving just a translucent layer. Crisscross fat with a knife. Sprinkle with salt and pepper. In a small nonstick pan over medium heat, heat the tablespoon of olive oil. Place lamb skin side down in pan, and cook 3 minutes. Flip lamb, and cook for 2 to 3 more minutes, or to taste. Remove and keep warm.",
    "Slice the lamb on the bias, and distribute evenly over four warm plates. Pour some of the reserved lamb sauce over the meat. Decorate with remaining fresh thyme."
