  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees. Line a 13-by-18-inch rimmed baking sheet with aluminum foil, allowing it to go up and over the edges of the pan. Line the bottom of the pan with a piece of parchment. Arrange matzo over parchment in an even layer, breaking pieces to fit as necessary.",
    "In a medium pot over medium-high heat, bring butter and sugar to a boil, whisking, until thickened and smooth, about 3 minutes. The mixture may separate, and that is O.K. Stir in vanilla and salt. Quickly pour mixture over matzos. Transfer baking sheet to oven and bake until bubbly, about 15 minutes.",
    "Remove from oven. Sprinkle chocolate evenly over caramel and let stand until softened, about 5 minutes. Use an offset spatula to spread chocolate smoothly over surface of toffee. If youâ€™ve used different kinds of chocolate, you can swirl them together decoratively.",
    "Immediately sprinkle melted chocolate with desired topping. Transfer baking sheet to refrigerator and chill toffee 1 hour to set chocolate. Break matzo toffee into large pieces for storing and serving."
