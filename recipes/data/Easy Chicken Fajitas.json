    "Peel and quarter 1 large onion and transfer to a blender. Add 1 bunch cilantro, zest and juice of 2 oranges, zest and juice of 3 limes, 6 garlic cloves, peeled, 4 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil, 2 Tbsp. ancho chile powder, 1 Tbsp. Diamond Crystal or 1¾ tsp. Morton kosher salt, 2 tsp. ground cumin, 1 tsp. dried Mexican oregano, 1 tsp. freshly ground pepper, 1 tsp. ground coriander, and 1 tsp. smoked paprika and blend marinade until smooth.",
    "Place 3 lb. skinless, boneless chicken thighs or breasts in a medium bowl. Pour marinade over and toss to coat. Let sit at room temperature at least 30 minutes or cover and chill up to 4 hours. If chilling, let sit at room temperature 30 minutes before cooking.",
    "Remove chicken from marinade, letting excess drip back into bowl, and place on a large plate; discard marinade. Pat chicken dry with paper towels, then season with a big pinch of salt. Heat remaining 2 Tbsp. extra-virgin olive oil in a large cast-iron skillet over medium-high. Working in batches and adding more oil between batches if pan looks dry, cook chicken in a single layer, undisturbed, until deep golden brown, about 5 minutes. Turn over and cook, on other side until an instant-read thermometer inserted into the thickest part registers 165° (or 160° if using chicken breasts), 5–7 minutes. Transfer chicken to a cutting board and tent loosely with foil. Wipe out skillet and reserve.",
    "Halve remaining 2 large onions through root end. Peel and slice ½\" thick. Add more oil to reserved skillet if needed and cook onions and 4 medium red, yellow, orange, and/or green bell peppers, ribs and stems removed, cut into ½\"-thick strips, undisturbed, 2 minutes. Sprinkle in ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt and ¼ tsp. freshly ground pepper and stir to combine. Continue to cook, stirring occasionally and adding 1 Tbsp. water at a time if vegetables are beginning to stick to bottom of pan to loosen brown bits (let water absorb completely before adding more), until vegetables are browned around the edges and softened, 8–12 minutes. Remove pan from heat. Taste onion mixture and season with more salt and pepper if needed.",
    "Remove foil from chicken and slice into ½\"-thick strips. Return to skillet; toss to combine. Serve with warm corn tortillas, sliced avocado, sour cream, coarsely grated Monterey Jack, pico de gallo, cilantro sprigs, and lime wedges for making fajitas."
