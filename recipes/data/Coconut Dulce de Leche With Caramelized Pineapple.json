  "instructions": [
    "In a large skillet over low heat, combine coconut milk and 135 grams (2/3 cup) sugar. Cook gently, stirring and scraping down the sides of the pan occasionally, until mixture is a deep caramel color, smooth and spreadable, about 1 1/2 to 3 hours, depending on how powerful your stove is. The mixture should remain at a low simmer; do not let it come to a boil. Scrape into a bowl or container and let cool thoroughly, then chill for at least 2 hours and up to 5 days before serving.",
    "Heat oven to 325 degrees. Spread coconut on a rimmed baking sheet and toast until golden around the edges, 8 to 12 minutes. Let cool.",
    "Toss pineapple with remaining 25 grams (2 tablespoons) sugar. Let fruit stand until sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes.",
    "Heat broiler and arrange an oven rack in the position closest to the flame. Spread fruit on a rimmed baking sheet. Broil 4 minutes. Stir, then broil until well-caramelized and charred in places, 3 to 4 minutes more.",
    "Spoon dulce de leche into 6 ramekins. Top each with warm pineapple and toasted coconut; sprinkle with salt if using and serve."
