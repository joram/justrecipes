    "Heat the oven to 300 degrees. Set the tofu block on one of its sides and cut it in half so that you have two rectangles, each about 1-inch thick. Cut each rectangle diagonally into 4 triangles about 1-inch thick.",
    "Spread the tofu on a large baking sheet lined with parchment and transfer to the oven. Cook undisturbed until the triangles develop a browned crust and start to separate from the pan, 45 to 60 minutes, depending on how dry you want them. You can increase the temperature to 400 degrees for the last 5 to 10 minutes of cooking to brown. Sprinkle with a little salt and transfer the tofu to a platter or gratin dish.",
    "Whisk together the oil, vinegar, Dijon, shallot and a sprinkle of salt and pepper in a small bowl. Pour the vinaigrette all over the tofu, and toss to make sure every piece is coated. Cover and refrigerate for at least 2 hours and up to a day. Serve cold or at room temperature."
