  "instructions": [
    "Make the phyllo dough: Combine flour and salt in the work bowl of a stand mixer fitted with dough hook. Add olive oil, vinegar and 1/2 cup cold water. Mix at medium speed for about 5 minutes to obtain a smooth, soft dough. If the dough seems dry, add up to 3 tablespoons more water. Wrap in plastic film and let rest for 15 minutes.",
    "Meanwhile, make the filling: Blanch greens in salted boiling water for 30 seconds. Drain, rinse with cool water, squeeze dry and chop fine. In a small bowl, put chopped greens, parsley, dill, oregano, black pepper to taste, a pinch of crushed chile pepper and the feta. Mix with a fork to combine.",
    "Give dough a quick knead and divide into 6 pieces. Dust dough with cornstarch or rice flour, then roll each piece of dough as thinly as possible, stretching gradually to a diameter of 16 inches. Alternatively, roll dough to the thinnest possible setting of a pasta machine. Cut each circle in half and dust pieces with cornstarch or rice flour and stack off to the side. Alternatively, roll dough to the thinnest possible setting of a pasta machine andÂ make smaller pies.",
    "Assemble the pies: Put a ridged stovetop grill or cast-iron skillet over medium-high heat. For each pie, lay 1 sheet phyllo on work surface and brush with olive oil. Cover half the sheet lightly with filling, using 3 to 4 tablespoons of mixture per pie. Fold over the other side and press down to seal pie. It will be a rough, very flat triangle shape.",
    "Brush both exterior sides with olive oil, carefully lay pie on the grill and cook for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden and crisp (reduce heat as necessary). Flip pie and cook the other side for 3 to 4 minutes, until golden and crisp. Remove and serve warm; cut into smaller pieces if desired. Continue to make pies with remaining ingredients."
