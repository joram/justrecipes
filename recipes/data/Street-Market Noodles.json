  "instructions": [
    "Place duck breast in a pan with water to cover and simmer over medium heat for 7 minutes. Drain; set aside until cool enough to handle.",
    "Meanwhile, bring 4 cups of water to a boil; add the noodles and cook 3 minutes, stirring constantly. Drain, rinse thoroughly under cold water, drain and place in a colander lined with paper towels to dry.",
    "When the duck is cool enough to handle, remove the skin and bones and slice the meat into thin strips.",
    "Heat the garlic oil in a wok or large skillet. Add the duck meat and stir-fry until it loses its color. Add all but 1 tablespoon of the scallions and stir-fry 1 minute. Add the noodles and mix. Mix in both soy sauces and the fish sauce, pepper and garlic. Stir-fry over low heat for 3 minutes.",
    "Transfer the noodle mixture to an oval platter. Sprinkle the fried onions and the reserved tablespoon of scallions on top. Serve with hot chili sauce on the side, if desired."
