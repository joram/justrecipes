  "instructions": [
    "Blend 2½ cups all-purpose flour, 1½ sticks (6 oz.) cold unsalted butter, cut into ½-inch cubes, ¼ cup (2 oz.) cold vegetable shortening (preferably trans-fat-free), and ½ tsp. Diamond Crystal or ¼ tsp. Morton kosher salt in a medium bowl with your fingertips or a pastry blender (or pulse in a food processor) just until mixture resembles coarse meal with some roughly pea-size butter lumps. Drizzle 5 Tbsp. ice water evenly over mixture and gently stir with a fork (or pulse) until incorporated.",
    "Squeeze a small handful of pie dough: If it doesn't hold together, add more ice water, 1 Tbsp. at a time, stirring (or pulsing) until incorporated. Do not overwork, or pastry will be tough.",
    "Turn pie dough out onto a work surface and divide into 8 portions. With heel of your hand, smear each portion once or twice in a forward motion to help distribute fat. Gather all pie dough together with pastry scraper. Divide pie dough with one half slightly larger, then form each piece into a ball and flatten each into a disk. Wrap each disk in plastic wrap and chill until firm, at least 1 hour and up to 2 days.",
    "Preheat oven to 425°F with rack in middle and put a large baking sheet on rack.",
    "Finely grind 3 Tbsp. quick-cooking tapioca in grinder.",
    "Split 1 vanilla bean (if using) lengthwise and scrape seeds into a large bowl with a small knife. Whisk in ground tapioca, 2 Tbsp. cornstarch, ½ tsp. cinnamon, ¼ tsp. Diamond Crystal or Morton kosher salt, and 1¼ cups sugar. Add 2 lb. fresh or frozen (not thawed) pitted sour cherries and 1½ tsp. pure vanilla extract (if using) and toss well. Let stand 30 minutes.",
    "Roll out larger piece of pie dough (keep remaining piece chilled) on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 14-inch round. Fit bottom crust into a 9-inch pie plate. Trim any excess dough to leave a ½-inch overhang. Chill shell while rolling out top crust.",
    "Roll out remaining pie dough on a lightly floured surface with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 12-inch round.",
    "Toss cherries well again, then add to shell and cover with top crust. Press edges of crust together, then trim, leaving a ½-inch overhang. Fold overhang underneath, then crimp decoratively and brush top crust with whole milk. Cut out 5 (1- by 1/2 -inch) teardrop-shaped steam vents 1 inch from center and sprinkle with 1 Tbsp. sugar.",
    "Bake pie on preheated baking sheet 30 minutes, then cover edge with a pie shield or foil and reduce oven temperature to 375°F. Continue to bake until crust is deep golden and filling is bubbling in center, 50 minutes to 1 hour more. Transfer pie to a rack to cool completely, 3 to 4 hours. Serve with vanilla ice cream or whipped cream. \n\nEditor’s note: This sour cherry pie recipe was first printed in the July 2007 issue of ‘Gourmet.’ Head this way for more of our best fruit pie recipes →"
