  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. In a medium bowl, whisk together the graham cracker crumbs, granulated sugar, cinnamon and salt. Add the butter and toss until the crumbs are evenly moistened. Transfer the mixture to a 9-inch pie plate and press into an even layer on the bottom and up the sides of the pie plate, packing the crust lightly with the bottom of a measuring cup. Place the pie plate on a sheet pan and bake for 10 to 12 minutes, until set, then cool completely.",
    "In a large mixing bowl, combine the cream cheese and confectionersâ€™ sugar. Using an electric mixer, beat on low speed until combined, then raise the speed to high and whip until the mixture is smooth and creamy. Add the heavy cream and vanilla, and beat on high speed until the mixture forms stiff peaks. Scrape the filling into the cooled crust, smooth the top, and chill for at least 2 hours, or overnight, until set. (Cover with plastic wrap if chilling the pie overnight.)",
    "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a boil and fill a large bowl with ice water. Immerse the peaches, a few at a time, in the boiling water for 30 seconds to 1 minute, depending on the ripeness of the peaches, until their skins peel off easily with a paring knife. Using a slotted spoon, transfer the peaches to the ice bath to stop the cooking. Peel the peaches, and cut into slices, placing the slices in a colander set over a bowl to drain any excess juices.",
    "Just before you plan to serve the pie, spoon the peaches onto the filling, covering the entire surface of the pie. Serve immediately or refrigerate for up to 1 hour before serving."
