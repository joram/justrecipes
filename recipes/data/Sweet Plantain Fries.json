  "instructions": [
    "Use a paring knife to cut a slit along the length of the plantains, carefully avoiding cutting into the flesh. Remove and discard peels. Slice plantains in half crosswise, then quarter each piece lengthwise into 4 wedges. (Each piece should be about the size of a chunky fry.)",
    "Pour about 1Â½ inch of neutral oil into a medium Dutch oven or high-sided cast-iron skillet and heat over medium. When the oil shimmers (it should be around 350 degrees), fry the plantains in batches until golden brown, flipping carefully with a slotted spoon, about 3 minutes and up to 6 minutes. (If any of the plantains stick to the bottom of the pot at first, release them carefully so they do not burn.) The plantains should be caramelized and slightly crisp at the edges but still tender in the middle.",
    "Using a slotted spoon, transfer the fries to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Season with salt to taste and repeat with remaining plantains. Serve immediately."
