  "instructions": [
    "Heat a gas grill to medium. If you are cooking on a charcoal grill, wait until the fire has died down to medium to low heat.",
    "Cut the peaches along their seams, all the way around, and twist their halves off their pits. Brush the cut sides of the peaches with olive oil and grill, cut side down, until the fruit has developed grill marks and started to soften, about 4 to 5 minutes.",
    "Brush the tops with oil, turn over and move to the side of the grill to continue cooking over indirect heat, another 4 to 5 minutes. You can add flavor by brushing them with maple syrup and bourbon, or molasses and butter. But if they are perfect peaches, they shouldnâ€™t need anything at all."
