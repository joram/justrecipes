  "instructions": [
    "Cook chicken and fortify stock Place the chicken, stock, peppercorns, bay leaf, and the salt in a large stockpot. Bring just to a boil, skimming foam from the surface, then reduce heat and simmer until chicken is just cooked through, 9 to 12 minutes for breast pieces and 12 to 18 minutes for legs and thighs. (Always check the thickest part to determine whether the chicken is cooked; the juices should run clear and an instant-read thermometer should register 160°F for breasts, 165°F for thighs.) Remove chicken from stock. Once it is cool enough to handle, slip off skin and pull meat from bones, then shred meat into bite-size pieces. Strain stock through a sieve into a clean saucepan.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare chiles Toast the chiles in a dry medium skillet over high heat until fragrant and charred, about 1 minute on each side. Let cool a bit, then split chiles lengthwise and scrape out seeds; discard seeds. Put chiles in a bowl and cover with warm water to soften, about 20 minutes (do not drain). If necessary, weight chiles with another bowl to keep them submerged.",
    "Make puree Heat broiler with rack about 5 inches below heat source. Lightly oil tomatoes and broil until charred in spots, about 5 minutes. Let cool briefly, then coarsely chop. Using the same skillet as above, heat oil over medium-high heat and sauté onion and garlic until translucent, about 3 minutes, stirring to prevent sticking. Add the tomatoes and cook 2 minutes more. Stir in chiles and soaking liquid. Allow mixture to cool slightly before pureeing in a blender until smooth. Strain mixture through a sieve, pressing with a flexible spatula to extract as much liquid as possible (discard solids).",
    "Finish soup Add puree to fortified stock and simmer over medium heat for 15 minutes, to allow the flavors to blend. Add shredded chicken and cook just to heat through, then stir in lime juice.",
    "Serve Ladle soup into serving bowls and serve garnishes in individual bowls alongside.",
    "Commonly used in moles, pasilla chiles are 6 to 8 inches long, with blackish brown skin and a mild flavor. Look for them in Mexican or Latino markets and the specialty foods sections of supermarkets. Other dried chiles, such as ancho or mirasol, are good alternatives.",
    "Cotija cheese is a semi-hard Mexican cheese made from cow’s milk. It is available in two varieties: the moist type is similar to feta and is perfect for crumbling over soups, salads, and tacos; firmer ones resemble Parmesan cheese in taste and texture and are more easily grated.",
    "The soup components can be prepared a day ahead: Cook and shred the chicken, then refrigerate in a covered container. Proceed with the recipe to make the chile puree, heating with the strained stock for 15 minutes. Let cool, then refrigerate in an airtight container. When you are ready to proceed, heat the stock, then add the chicken and cook just until it is heated through. Stir in lime juice at the end.",
    "Except for the tortillas, which can be fried 1 to 2 days ahead and kept at room temperature, the garnishes should be prepared as close to serving as possible. Once the stock is simmering, slice the onion and cabbage, cut the limes, grate the cheese, and dice the avocado (toss with a bit of lime juice to prevent it from turning brown)."
