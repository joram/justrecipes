  "instructions": [
    "Prepare the crust: In a medium skillet over medium-low heat, toast the coconut until deep golden brown while stirring constantly, 7 to 9 minutes. (Watch carefully to avoid burning.) Cool slightly.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine the toasted shredded coconut, Biscoff cookie crumbs (or graham cracker crumbs and brown sugar), butter and salt. Stir until well combined, then pour the mixture into a 9-inch (23-centimeter) springform pan. Use a measuring cup or flat-bottomed glass to firmly press the mixture onto the bottom and about 1 1/2 inch up the sides of the pan. Refrigerate while you make the filling.",
    "Prepare the filling: Turn the chilled cans of coconut milk upside-down and open them. There should be a layer of liquid visible. (If there isnâ€™t, push aside the hardened cream to reveal it.) Pour the liquid into a storage container, and save it for another use. There should be a thick layer of coconut cream remaining in the can. Scrape the coconut cream into a bowl, leaving behind any visible coconut oil, and use an electric mixer on medium-high speed to beat it until smooth and fluffy, about 1 to 2 minutes. Set aside.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment, combine the cream cheese, sugar, lemon juice, lemon zest and salt. Beat the mixture on low speed until combined, then turn the mixer up to medium-high and beat until just smooth, about 30 seconds. Take care not to overbeat, or the cake will not be firm enough when chilled. Add the whipped coconut cream and beat just until well combined and smooth, about 30 seconds more.",
    "Spoon the mixture into the prepared crust and use an offset spatula to smooth or swirl the top. Chill at least 8 hours.",
    "Prepare the topping: Combine 1 1/2 cups of the berries, the sugar, the lemon juice and the zest in a small saucepan and crush the berries with a fork or potato masher. Cook over medium heat until thick and jammy, about 10 minutes. Cool completely, then fold in the remaining 1 1/2 cups berries. Serve each slice of cheesecake with a spoonful of berries and, if using, a sprinkle of toasted coconut chips over the top."
