  "instructions": [
    "In a liquid measuring cup or small bowl, stir the sugar into the water until it dissolves, then stir in the yeast. Let stand until foamy, 5 to 10 minutes. Pour in the oil.",
    "Combine the flour and salt in a food processor. With the machine running, add the yeast mixture through the feed tube. Process until the dough forms a sticky mass that clings to the sides of the bowl, scraping the bowl down once, about 1 minute. (Alternatively, beat in an electric stand mixer with the paddle attachment or stir vigorously with a wooden spoon until stretchy, about 5 minutes.) The dough will be very wet and not form a ball.",
    "Grease a large bowl with olive oil and scrape the dough into it. Cover with a clean kitchen towel and let rise in a warm place until almost doubled, about 1 hour (see Tip).",
    "Very generously coat a quarter-sheet pan or 9-by-13-inch cake pan with olive oil. Scrape the dough into it and gently nudge and press it into an even layer, oiling your fingers if the dough sticks. Lightly sprinkle with salt. Cover with the clean kitchen towel and let rise until it’s ½-inch tall, 20 to 30 minutes (see Tip). (If using a sheet pan, pull the towel tight so it doesn’t rest on the dough.)",
    "Meanwhile, heat the oven to 425 with a rack in the lower third.",
    "Uncover the dough and bake until golden brown on top, 20 to 25 minutes. When you press the top of the dough it should feel springy. As soon as the bread comes out, brush the top generously with olive oil, then lightly sprinkle with salt. Cool in the pan for at least 10 minutes. Use a knife to cut around the edges of the bread to remove it from the pan."
