    "Trim root ends off brussels sprouts, discarding any discolored outer leaves. Cut a shallow ''X'' into root end of each sprout.",
    "Place sprouts in large steamer with an inch or two of water. Bring to a boil, reduce heat to medium-low, and steam sprouts until just tender and still bright green, 5 to 7 minutes, depending on size. Drain, and rinse under cold water until cool. Drain thoroughly, and transfer to a large bowl.",
    "In a small bowl, stir together soy sauce, sesame oil, vinegar and sugar. Pour over sprouts, and toss gently to coat well. Cover, and refrigerate at least 4 hours, and up to 24 hours. Serve chilled."
