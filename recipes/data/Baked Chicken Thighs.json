    "In a large bowl, combine the olive oil, garlic, mustard, thyme, salt and pepper. Zest the lemon over the bowl, reserving the rest of the lemon for serving, and whisk until combined. ",

    "Heat the oven to 425 degrees and lift the chicken thighs from the marinade, letting any excess drip into the bowl. Place the thighs on a sheet pan and let them sit at room temperature while the oven heats. Bake until fully cooked and lightly browned, 25 to 30 minutes. An internal thermometer inserted into the thickest part of the meat should read 165 to 175 degrees.",
    "Cut the lemon in half and squeeze over the chicken. Sprinkle with salt and serve. "
