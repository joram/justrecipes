    "In a food processor or blender, combine the cilantro, mint, mango pulp, lime juice and chiles, and blend at high speed until smooth. Season with salt to taste, then add water as needed, pulsing to combine, to achieve a thick and slightly chunky consistency. Adjust the seasoning with lime juice and salt as needed.",
    "This chutney will keep refrigerated in a covered container for up to 1 week. After that, the vivid green color will begin to lose its vibrancy, though the chutney will still taste delicious for a full 2 weeks."
