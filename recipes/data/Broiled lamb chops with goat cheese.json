  "instructions": [
    "Preheat the broiler to high.",
    "Roll the ''tail'' of each lamb chop into a compact circle. Secure the tails to the chops with toothpicks or other skewers.",
    "Sprinkle the chops on both sides with salt and pepper. Put the chops on a rack and place them under the broiler, the tops of the chops about four inches from the source of heat. Let cook seven to eight minutes or until well browned. If desired, leave the broiler door slightly ajar. Turn the chops and continue cooking on the second side four to five minutes. Brush the top of each with a little melted butter.",
    "Sprinkle the top of each chop with three tablespoons of cheese. Sprinkle each with one-quarter teaspoon of rosemary. Dribble the remaining butter evenly over the chops. Return the chops to the broiler, and let cook until cheese is piping hot and slightly melted, five minutes or less. Sprinkle with parsley and serve."
