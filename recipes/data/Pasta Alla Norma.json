  "instructions": [
    "Peel the eggplants and slice them crosswise into disks less than one-half-inch thick. Layer the slices in a bowl, sprinkling coarse kosher salt over each layer. Place a plate over the slices and place a weight on top. Let sit for 30 minutes.",
    "Rinse the eggplant slices well and pat them dry with paper towels. Heat the oil in a large skillet over medium heat. Add the garlic cloves and saute for two minutes. Add the eggplant and saute for 15 minutes, turning once or twice. Season with salt and pepper to taste, then pour in one-half cup of cold water. Cover and cook 20 minutes, stirring occasionally.",
    "Meanwhile, bring a large pot of water to a full boil. Add coarse salt to taste, then add pasta. Cook until al dente, about 9 to 12 minutes.",
    "Remove the garlic from the eggplant and discard. Drain the pasta well, place it in a shallow serving bowl and pour the eggplant sauce over. Toss well. Sprinkle with parsley and serve with additional ground black pepper."
