    "Put the mussels with a quarter-cup of water in a large pot with a tightly fitting lid. Cook for 10 minutes, shaking the pot - holding the cover on - once during cooking. Remove from heat. Allow to cool until the mussels can be handled. Shell the mussels, using one shell as tweezers. Place the meat in a very large bowl. Discard the shells. Strain the mussel liquid through a sieve lined with a damp cloth. Reserve.",
    "Bring three quarts of water with the salt to a boil in a large pot. Drop in the shrimp. Stir. Cover the pot and turn off the heat. Let the shrimp steep for five minutes. Drain in a large colander. Add to the mussels.",
    "Open the boxes of artichoke hearts. Place the artichokes in a sieve under hot running water until they can be separated. Place in bowl of hot water until thoroughly defrosted. Drain and add them to the shrimp and mussels.",
    "Add the celery and onions and stir.",
    "Whisk together the marinade ingredients. Pour over the salad. With hands or large spoons, mix thoroughly. Cover the bowl with plastic wrap and refrigerate. Stir once or twice before dinner."
