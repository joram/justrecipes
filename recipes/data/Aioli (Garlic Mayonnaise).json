    "Mash the garlic to a smooth paste in a mortar with a pinch of salt; set aside 1/3 of the paste. To the rest of the garlic add 1/2 teaspoon room-temperature water, 1/4 teaspoon salt and the egg yolk, stirring well. Slowly whisk in the olive oil, a few drops at a time. As the mixture begins to thicken, begin adding the oil in a slow, steady stream. If the aioli becomes too \nthick, thin it with a bit of water, and continue. After all the oil has been mixed in, taste for salt and garlic, and adjust accordingly. Serve with salmon and vegetables."
