    "Heat the oil over medium-high heat in a heavy cast iron or nonstick frying pan. When it is very hot, place as many cabbage wedges as will fit in one layer in the pan. Cook for three to five minutes until golden brown on one side. Using tongs or a spatula, turn over and cook on the other side until tender, nicely browned and crispy on the edges, about five minutes. Season generously with salt and pepper, and serve hot."
