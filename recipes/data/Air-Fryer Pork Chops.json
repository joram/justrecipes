  "instructions": [
    "Heat air fryer to 375 degrees, if preheating is recommended for your air fryer. ",
    "Pat pork chops dry with paper towels. Season the pork chops with salt on both sides. In a shallow plate or small bowl, combine the sugar,  cumin and coriander. Season pork chops all over with cumin mixture, rubbing until fully coated. (Pork chops can be seasoned just before cooking or up to 12 hours in advance. If seasoning the pork chops in advance, let them sit, uncovered, in the refrigerator, to allow the salt and sugar to settle into the pork chops, permeating and tenderizing them. Let the pork chops come to room temperature before cooking.)",
    "Transfer seasoned pork chops to the air fryer basket and cook until beautifully browned and cooked through, flipping halfway through, about 5 minutes per side.",
    "Allow pork chops to rest for 5 minutes before slicing and serving."
