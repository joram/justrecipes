    "Wash the rice in a large bowl and pour out the water. Repeat until the water runs clear, then drain the rice thoroughly using a sieve. ",
    "Add rice and 1 1/2 cups water to a small saucepan; the water level should be about 1 inch above the rice. Heat over high. Once the water boils, about 6 minutes, cover the pot and reduce the heat to low. Cook, undisturbed, for 12 minutes. Turn the heat off and let sit for 10 minutes. Do not remove the lid; the rice will finish cooking in its own steam. Uncover and fluff the rice using a fork. Serve. "
