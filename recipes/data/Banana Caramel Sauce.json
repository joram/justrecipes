Carefully pour in cream (it will sputter). Let the mixture cool slightly and return to the heat. Add the bananas. Stir until sugar melts again and the mixture is smooth (except for the bananas).",
    "Place the chocolate in a large bowl, pour the hot cream mixture over it and stir until the chocolate melts. Serve warm."
