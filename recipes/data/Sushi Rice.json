    "In a fine strainer, rinse the rice with cold running water, until water runs clear. Pour rice into pot with 2 cups cold water; let sit 30 minutes.",
    "Bring rice to a boil over medium-high heat; immediately turn heat to low, and cover. Cook 10 minutes, remove from heat and let sit, covered, 15 minutes. In a small saucepan, dissolve the sugar and salt in the rice vinegar over a low flame. Pour evenly over rice and fold gently with a wooden spoon to mix. Leave rice in front of a fan, or fan with a piece of cardboard for 15 minutes or until rice is just above room temperature."
