  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 225 degrees. While oven heats, mix together dry ingredients and rub them all over pork.",
    "Layer bottom of roasting pan with hickory or oak chips and add enough water to create a shallow pool coating bottom of pan and moistening chips; do not drown them.",
    "Put a rack over chips and put rubbed meat on rack. Cover entire roasting pan tightly with foil, making a tent at top so smoke-flavored steam can circulate around meat. Bake for 2 1/2 to 3 hours, or until meat is cooked and tender.",
    "Carefully remove foil from pan and run ribs under broiler, watching carefully, until nicely crisp and browned, about 5 minutes."
