    "Rinse the fish. Pat dry, then place in a heat-proof dish.",
    "Set a rack in a pot and add water to a depth of 1 1/2 to 2 inches. (If you use a steamer, fill half the lower tier with water.) Bring to a boil. Set dish on rack (or on upper tier of steamer) and steam over high heat for 15 to 20 minutes, depending on the thickness of the fish.",
    "Test for doneness by poking a chopstick or sharp knife through the thickest part of the fish. It should flake easily and look opaque all the way to the bone.",
    "When fish is done, use a turkey baster or spoon to discard any accumulated liquid.",
    "Sprinkle ginger, scallion and optional cilantro over fish. Heat oil in a small skillet. Add soy sauce and heat for a few seconds. Pour mixture over fish. Serve immediately."
