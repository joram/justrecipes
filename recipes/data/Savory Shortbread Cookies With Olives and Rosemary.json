    "In a medium bowl, combine the flour, sugar, salt and rosemary. Zest the lemon into the bowl, add the butter and rub the pieces into the flour mixture using your fingers until small pebbles form. (Alternatively, use a food processor to pulse the dry ingredients with the butter.) ",
    "Add the chopped olives, tossing to coat with the flour mixture. Pour the cream over the mixture, stir just until combined and squeeze until the dough comes together in a clump. Divide the dough in two equal 9-inch logs. Wrap each log firmly in a strip of parchment paper and twist the ends shut. Refrigerate until the dough is firm enough to slice, about 30 minutes and up to 3 days. ",
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Line a sheet pan with parchment paper. Slice each log into ½-inch rounds. Lay the rounds on the prepared baking sheet, spacing at least ½ inch apart.",
    "Bake until the cookies are golden at the bottom edges, about 22 minutes, rotating once halfway through baking. Move the cookies to a wire rack to cool completely. Store at room temperature in an airtight container for up to 3 days. The baked cookies can also be stored frozen in an airtight container for up to 5 days. Thaw at room temperature before serving."
