  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 300 degrees and set one rack in the middle of the oven. Line a large baking sheet with parchment paper and set aside. In a large bowl, mix together oats, almonds, coconut chips (if using) and pepitas.",
    "In a small saucepan, combine honey and sugar. Stir over medium heat until mixture starts to simmer and sugar dissolves, 1 to 2 minutes; turn off heat. Stir in coconut oil, red-pepper flakes and salt. (If coconut oil is solid, allow it to fully melt.) Fold warm liquid mixture into oat mixture until well combined. Spread oat mixture evenly on the lined baking sheet.",
    "Bake granola on the middle rack for 15 minutes. Remove the baking sheet from the oven, leaving the oven on, and stir granola to redistribute any bits along the edge into the center and vice versa. Bake until oats, nuts and coconut chips are deeply toasted and have a light sheen, an additional 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "Let granola cool on tray, at least 1 hour. Stir in freeze-dried strawberries, which will break up a bit as you mix them in. (Makes 5 cups.) Serve granola over yogurt and jam, if desired. Granola keeps, in an airtight container, for 2 weeks at room temperature."
