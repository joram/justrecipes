  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 425 degrees. In a large bowl, toss the cauliflower with the olive oil. Season well with the salt, pepper and red-pepper flakes, if using, and toss again. Spread the mixture evenly onto a large sheet pan and roast until crisp and golden, about 25 to 30 minutes, tossing halfway through to ensure even browning.",
    "Meanwhile, toast the almonds in a skillet over medium-low heat, stirring frequently to ensure they donâ€™t burn, about 4 to 5 minutes. Remove from heat and set aside.",
    "Once the cauliflower is roasted, toss it in a large bowl with the feta cheese, olives, half the almonds and 1 tablespoon parsley until combined. Top with remaining almonds and parsley, and lemon. Season with flaky salt, if desired."
