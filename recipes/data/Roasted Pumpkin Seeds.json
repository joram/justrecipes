  "instructions": [
    "To clean the pumpkin seeds of pumpkin slime and flesh, put the seeds in a large bowl filled with cold water. The seeds will float to the top. Skim them out with your hands, pulling away any flesh that’s stuck on the seeds. Shake the seeds in your hand to get of any excess water, then transfer to a baking sheet.",
    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees. Pat the seeds down with a paper towel, then toast them until they’re dry and tacky, about 5 minutes.",
    "Pull baking sheet out of the oven. Drizzle the seeds with the olive oil and sprinkle with 1 teaspoon salt. Toss to coat, then spread into an even layer. Return seeds to oven, and bake, stirring occasionally, until light golden brown, 25 to 30 minutes.",
    "Let cool. Seeds will keep in an airtight container at room temperature for 1 week."
