    "Heat the oven to 350 degrees.Â To an 8-inch square (or round) baking dish, add the plums, 3 tablespoons brown sugar, 1 tablespoon flour and 1/4 teaspoon salt. Toss everything together to coat and set aside.",
    "In a medium mixing bowl, combine the graham cracker crumbs with the remaining 1/4 cup flour, 2 tablespoons brown sugar and 1/4 teaspoon salt.",
    "In a small bowl, combine the butter and vanilla. Using a spoon, mix it into the graham cracker mixture until the crumbs are evenly moist, then spread it over the plums, pressing down with your palms to create an even, compact layer.",
    "Bake about 30 minutes or until the crust is golden brown and hardened and plum juice is bubbling up along the edges of the pan. Remove from the oven and let cool for at least 5 minutes. Serve warm or at room temperature."
