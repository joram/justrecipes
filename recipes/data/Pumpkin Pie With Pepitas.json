    "Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat oven to 400 degrees. Scatter the pumpkin seeds on a small rimmed baking sheet and toast, shaking once or twice, until golden brown and puffed, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from oven and let cool completely.",
    "Remove the cold pie dough from the refrigerator and let it sit at room temperature for a minute or two to soften slightly. Unwrap the dough and place it on a lightly floured surface. Using a rolling pin, beat the dough evenly across the surface, applying enough force to leave an imprint but not enough to crack or splinter it. Continue to beat the dough, lifting it frequently and adding more flour if needed to prevent sticking, until it’s just under ½-inch thick. This makes the dough pliable and easier to roll out while cold. 3. Dust underneath and on top of the dough with more flour, then roll it out, frequently lifting and rotating the dough to work it into a round, until it’s about ⅛-inch thick and 13 inches in diameter.",
    "Transfer pastry to a 9-inch pie plate, and firmly press into the bottom and up the sides of the plate, ensuring contact everywhere and taking care not to stretch it. Use scissors to cut along the edge of the pastry, leaving a ½-inch overhang (discard the scraps). Tuck the overhang underneath itself all the way around so you have a thick lip of pastry resting on the rim. Press down firmly along the rim, then crimp the crust all the way around, using the thumb of one hand and the thumb and forefinger of the other, flouring your fingers as needed to prevent sticking.",
    "Freeze the lined pie plate until the dough is very firm, 10 to 15 minutes, then prick the bottom of the pastry in several places with a fork. Line the inside of the pie plate with two pieces of foil, arranged perpendicularly, so the foil overhang completely covers the crimped edge. Fill the pie plate with dried beans or rice and place on a foil-lined baking sheet. Bake in the center of the oven until the edge of the crust is set and starting to turn golden when you peek under the foil, 25 to 30 minutes. Remove the plate from the oven and carefully lift the foil and pie weights out of the crust. Reduce the oven temperature to 325 degrees, then return the pan to the oven and bake until the crust is golden brown all over, another 20 to 25 minutes.",
    "While the crust is baking, combine the cream, butter and ¼ cup/60 milliliters maple syrup in a small saucepan and heat over medium-high, stirring occasionally, until steaming, then set aside (Be careful: It will sputter if it comes to a boil). In a large bowl, combine eggs, brown sugar, vanilla, cinnamon, salt, allspice and cloves, and whisk vigorously until no streaks remain. Whisking constantly, stream in the hot cream mixture, then whisk in the pumpkin purée until the mixture is smooth. Set the filling aside.",
    "In a medium bowl, combine the remaining 2 tablespoons maple syrup and toasted pumpkin seeds, then add 1 tablespoon filling and toss the mixture until seeds are evenly coated.",
    "Once crust is out of the oven, carefully pour in the filling (you may have a bit of filling left over). Scatter the pumpkin seed mixture over the filling in an even layer all the way to the crust, then use the back of a spoon to gently spread them out a bit. Bake until the filling is puffed and there is no wobble in the center when you shake the baking sheet, 40 to 55 minutes. Remove the pie from the oven and set on a wire rack to cool completely before slicing and serving with whipped cream."
