  "instructions": [
    "Combine 1/4 cup of the warm water, 1 tablespoon of the light brown sugar, and the yeast in the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the paddle attachment (not bread hook). Use a wooden spoon or whisk to mix well. Make sure the yeast is completely dissolved.",
    "Whisk together the flour mix, millet flour, xanthan gum, and cardamom. Set aside.",
    "In a pan, combine the mashed potatoes, remaining 1 cup water, salt, 1/3 cup of the vegetable shortening, rice milk powder, and remaining 1/3 cup light brown sugar. Mix well. Heat until warm and the shortening has melted. Let come to 110° to 115°F.",
    "Add the egg replacer to the yeast mixture, stirring well. Add the potato mixture to the yeast mixture and beat on medium speed until combined, about 1 minute.",
    "Add the flour mixture to the liquid mixture in two batches, mixing well on medium speed for about 1 minute, until the dough is fully combined.",
    "Grease a 9 by 5-inch loaf pan liberally with vegetable shortening.",
    "Use a rubber spatula to turn the dough out onto a well-floured board, flour your hands well, and pat the dough into a disk 7 inches in diameter and 1 1/2 inches thick. Flip, and then pat into a rectangle about 11 inches long and 1 1/2 inches thick. Roll up, starting from the longer edge, and seal the seam tightly, pressing down lightly to press out any trapped air pockets. Make sure the seam is on the bottom. Tuck both ends of the loaf under (against the seam), so the dough will fit in the loaf pan. The dough will be soft, but don’t worry, it’s supposed to be. Transfer to the loaf pan. Melt the remaining 1 tablespoon shortening (about 30 seconds in the microwave should do it) and use a pastry brush to coat the top of the loaf. Cover with a folded clean dish towel or cloth napkin. Place the loaf pan in a dishpan and pour hot water to come two-thirds up the sides of the loaf (or just fill your kitchen sink basin). Be sure to fold your cloth so it’s not dragging in the water. Let the loaf rise for 1 hour. I generally replace the hot water with new hot water after the first 30 minutes. Check it periodically to make sure it’s still quite warm.",
    "After the dough has risen for 1 hour and has about doubled in size, place the loaf in a cold oven. Set the temperature to 400°F and bake for 20 minutes. Reduce the temperature to 325°F and bake for 40 minutes longer, or until the loaf is deeply golden on top. Transfer to a cooling rack, turn out of the pan, and let cool (if you can wait that long!).",
    "Contrary to popular belief, bread products actually dry out faster in the fridge. When storing your gluten-free breads, let them cool completely, then wrap them tightly in foil, plastic wrap, or a freezer bag (with the extra air squeezed out) and store them at room temperature, preferably in a bread box. To crisp up your crust again, just reheat the bread in a 350°F oven for about 15 minutes until warmed through. Or slice and toast individual slices. You may also store your breads in the freezer for up to 3 months. Just remove from the freezer, let defrost to room temperature, and rewarm in the oven as directed above."
