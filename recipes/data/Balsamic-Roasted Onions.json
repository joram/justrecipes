    "Slice about 1/4-inch from top and bottom of each onion. Peel onions, removing outer layer of flesh as well. Score onions about 3/4 of the way down, cutting at 1/4-inch intervals in a crisscross pattern. Place onions in a bowl of ice water for 2 to 4 hours, until cut area looks ruffled. Drain upside down 10 minutes.",
    "Heat oven to 375 degrees. Place onions in a baking dish that holds them closely.",
    "Beat vinegar and honey together, and season with salt and pepper. Brush over onions. Dot each with butter. Pour cider into baking dish. Cover dish with foil and bake 30 minutes. Uncover and baste with pan juices. Bake uncovered 30 minutes more, basting every 10 minutes. Baste again and serve."
