    "In a 12-inch skillet or Dutch oven, combine 1 tablespoon oil and the garlic. Place over medium heat and saut√© garlic until golden. Using a slotted spoon, transfer garlic to a plate and set aside.",
    "Set aside a colander placed over a bowl. Place pasta in unwashed skillet (if pasta is very long it may not lie flat on bottom until it begins to soften). Add 2 teaspoons salt and 8 cups cold water.",
    "Place over high heat and cook uncovered, stirring frequently to keep pasta submerged, until pasta is almost al dente, 8 to 10 minutes, depending on pasta. Tilt pan and spoon off as much liquid as possible into a bowl, so that very little is left in pan. Add remaining 1/4 cup oil, reserved garlic, parsley and red pepper. Return just enough cooking liquid to pasta, tossing them together, to make a creamy sauce. Adjust salt as needed. Serve immediately."
