    "Bring a large pot of water to a boil and salt generously. Add pasta and peas. While pasta is cooking, mix together garlic, ricotta and tarragon in a large bowl. Season to taste with salt and pepper.",
    "When the pasta is cooked al dente, remove 1/4 cup of the pasta water and mix 2 to 4 tablespoons of it with the ricotta. It should have the consistency of cream. Add a little more water if it doesnâ€™t. Drain pasta and peas and toss with ricotta mixture and Parmesan. Serve at once."
