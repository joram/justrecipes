  "instructions": [
    "In a large pot, heat the butter over medium. When melted, add the shallots and cook until softened, 1 to 3 minutes. Add the corn, half-and-half and cayenne or thyme, if using; stir to combine. When you see bubbles around the edge of the pot, reduce heat to medium-low, cover and simmer until the corn is tender, 5 to 10 minutes for frozen and canned corn and 10 to 15 minutes for fresh corn. (Do not add salt yet; it will toughen the corn.) Remove from heat.",
    "Transfer a third of the corn (about 1 cup) to a blender and blend until very smooth. (Add 1 or 2 tablespoons of half-and-half to get things moving in the blender, if necessary.) Stir the pur√©e back into the corn mixture. If the creamed corn is too loose, simmer uncovered over medium-low until thickened. If the creamed corn is too tight, thin with more half-and-half.",
    "Season to taste with salt and pepper, then top with serving additions, if desired."
