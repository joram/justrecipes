  "instructions": [
    "Put a large wide skillet on the stove. Add about 1 inch water, salt it well, cover the skillet, and place over high heat. When water comes to a rapid boil, add asparagus in one layer, cover, and cook for 2 minutes, or just until barely done.",
    "Drain asparagus and keep warm loosely wrapped in a kitchen towel.",
    "Return skillet to stovetop over high heat. Add butter and swirl pan, then add chopped sage and sage leaves.",
    "When butter gets foamy, lightly browned and nutty-smelling, a minute or two, stir in lemon juice and zest and turn the heat to low.",
    "Put cooked asparagus back in pan and season with salt and pepper. Shake pan gently to coat with butter sauce. Using tongs, transfer asparagus to a large warmed platter. Spoon remaining sauce over asparagus, sprinkle with pistachios and serve."
