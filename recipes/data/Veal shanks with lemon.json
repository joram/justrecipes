    "Dredge the pieces of shank in flour seasoned with salt and pepper.",
    "Heat the oil in a heavy skillet large enough to hold the pieces in one layer and cook the pieces, turning often, until they are browned all over.",
    "Pour off the fat from the skillet. Scatter the onions and garlic around the meat, and cook, stirring, until the vegetables are wilted.",
    "Add the wine, and stir to dissolve the brown particles that cling to the bottom and sides of the skillet. Add the broth, lemon juice, thyme and parsley, and stir. Cover closely and bring to the boil. Cook over moderate heat one hour and 15 minutes. Stir in the lemon rind and serve."
