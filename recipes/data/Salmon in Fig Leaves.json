    "Preheat the oven to 350. Cut the salmon into 6 equal portions. Coat lightly with olive oil, and season with salt and freshly ground pepper.",
    "Wash the fig leaves, and leave them moistened. Place 4 on a baking sheet, and lay the salmon pieces on top. Scatter small \npieces of fennel frond on top of the fish, and cover with the remaining fig leaves. Bake in the upper part of the oven until the fish is just cooked through, 10 to 12 minutes, then transfer the salmon to a serving platter immediately. Serve with blanched new potatoes and green beans, tomatoes, cucumber, hard-cooked eggs and aioli."
