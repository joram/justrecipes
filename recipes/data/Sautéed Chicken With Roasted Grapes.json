  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 375 degrees. Line a rimmed sheet pan with parchment paper or a nonstick baking mat. Put half the grapes in the pan and roast 1 hour, turning grapes after 30 minutes. They will become wrinkled and golden",
    "Meanwhile, in a blender, purée remaining grapes until smooth. Strain through a sieve, pressing to release all juices from skins. Discard skins.",
    "In a large, heavy nonstick skillet, melt half the butter over high heat. Sprinkle chicken with salt and pepper and cook on both sides until golden brown, reducing the heat to prevent scorching, about 4 minutes per side. Add strained grape purée and simmer until chicken is cooked through and juice is syrupy, about 5 minutes. Transfer chicken to a serving platter and keep warm. Whisk remaining butter into sauce and cook over high heat for 1 minute. Add roasted grapes and heat through, then pour sauce and grapes over chicken. Sprinkle with chives and serve."
