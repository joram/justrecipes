    "Slice each cucumber half as if quartering lengthwise, but leave the last half-inch intact. Rub thoroughly with salt, and add the remainder from the cup to 1/2 cup water; allow the cucumbers to macerate in the salted water for 30 minutes. Rinse and drain them for 10 minutes.",
    "Mix together well the remaining ingredients, including the tablespoon of salt. Place about 2 tablespoons of stuffing between the &quot;fingers&quot; of each cucumber half. Place the cucumbers in a jar with a tight lid and add the remaining stuffing.",
    "Leave at room temperature for 4 days and serve, reassembling the cucumbers with stuffing as necessary."
