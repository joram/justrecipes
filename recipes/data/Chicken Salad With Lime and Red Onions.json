  "instructions": [
    "Remove any excess fat from the cavity of the chicken and place the chicken and giblets (excluding the liver) in a large stockpot. Add the white peppercorns, ginger, sea salt and 4 quarts of water to the pot. Place over medium-high heat and bring to a boil. Lower the heat and simmer, uncovered, until the chicken is very tender, about 30 minutes.",
    "Remove the chicken from the pot and set aside to cool. Strain the broth, discarding the solids, and reserve for another use.",
    "When the chicken is cool, use your hands to remove and discard the skin. Pull the meat from the carcass and discard the carcass. Place the meat in a large bowl and use your fingers to finely shred it. Add the onions, lime juice, salt, black pepper and mint to the bowl and toss until thoroughly mixed. Serve at room temperature."
