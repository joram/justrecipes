    "Position a rack in the oven nearest to the heat source, on the highest or lowest spot depending on your model. Heat the oven to 450 degrees. Grease the center of a large sheet pan with 1 tablespoon olive oil.",
    "Flatten the dough in between your hands, then rotate the round in your hands like a wheel and pull it outwards to stretch into a 12-inch circle. Place the dough on the sheet pan. Evenly spread the tomato sauce over the dough, leaving a 1/4-inch border. Sprinkle with mozzarella, then top with ham and pineapple. Lightly drizzle with olive oil.",
    "Bake until the crust is browned and the toppings are slightly caramelized, about 12 minutes. Sprinkle with red-pepper flakes. Cool at least 10 minutes before cutting."
