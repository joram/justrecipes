    "In a 750-milliliter bottle, combine all ingredients except lemon peel. If the sangaree is not being served immediately, it may be kept, tightly corked, in refrigerator up to a week. To serve, pour 4 ounces sangaree and one lemon twist for each serving into a small pot. Heat until just before boiling. Strain into a small mug or teacup and garnish with a fresh lemon twist."
