  "instructions": [
    "Place onion rings in a bowl, cover with cold water and squeeze them with your hands seven or eight times to release a slightly milky liquid into the water (in the process the onion becomes milder). Drain onion rings, replace in the bowl and re-cover with water. Repeat this procedure two or three times. Before using the onions, gather them tightly in your hand to squeeze out all excess moisture.",
    "Put the beans and onion in a serving bowl, sprinkle liberally with salt and toss.",
    "Drain the tuna, and add it to the bowl, breaking it into large flakes with a fork.",
    "Pour on enough olive oil to coat the mixture well, add a dash of vinegar and a generous amount of pepper. Toss thoroughly and check for seasoning; then serve."
