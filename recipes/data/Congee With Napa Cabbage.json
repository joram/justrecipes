  "instructions": [
    "To make the congee, place both kinds of rice in a large pot. Wash the rice 3 times under water, rubbing between your hands. Drain.",
    "Return the rice to the pot, add the 8 1/2 cups water, cover and bring to a boil. Leave the lid open a crack. Reduce the heat to medium-low and cook for 1 to 1 1/2 hours, stirring occasionally to prevent the rice from sticking to the bottom of the pot. Cook until the rice thickens almost to the consistency of porridge.",
    "Meanwhile, to make the scallion oil, heat a wok or heavy skillet over medium heat. Add the oil, then the scallions. Cook until the scallions turn brown, about 3 minutes. Strain through a fine sieve. Let cool to room temperature.",
    "About 7 minutes before the rice is completely cooked, add the bok choy stalks, soy sauce, salt, white pepper and ginger. Mix together thoroughly and bring the congee to a boil, stirring constantly. Reduce the heat, add the bok choy leaves and cook for 2 to 3 minutes longer. Turn off the heat, remove the ginger and add 2 to 3 tablespoons of the scallion oil, stirring it well into the mixture. Serve hot."
