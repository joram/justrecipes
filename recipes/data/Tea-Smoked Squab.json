    "Rinse and dry the squabs thoroughly.",
    "Place the salt, peppercorns, star anise and cinnamon sticks in a dry skillet and toast by shaking over medium heat until the mixture begins to smoke and the salt begins to turn brown. Allow to cool. Discard the star anise and cinnamon and rub salt and peppercorns over the squabs, inside and out. Cover the squabs loosely and set in a cool place or in the refrigerator for eight hours or overnight.",
    "Place the squabs, breast side down, on a heat-proof plate. Place in a steamer or a covered wok fitted with a rack and steam 30 minutes. Allow squabs to cool, then rub with soy sauce.",
    "Cover the bottom of a wok with aluminum foil. Place the rice, brown sugar and tea in it. Place a rack in the wok and arrange the squabs breast side up on the rack. Line the cover of the wok with foil, cover the wok and seal the edge of the cover with dampened paper towels to keep the smoke from escaping.",
    "Turn the heat to medium high and when you smell smoke leave the heat on for 15 minutes. Turn the heat off and keep the birds in the covered wok for 45 minutes.",
    "In a large wok or deep fryer heat the oil, add the squabs one at a time and deep fry them for five minutes to crisp the skin. Pat dry with paper towels. Serve warm or at room temperature."
