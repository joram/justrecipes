    "Rinse the shrimp. Dry thoroughly and set aside.",
    "Combine the three peppers in a small skillet and heat, shaking, until the Sichuan peppercorns begin to smoke. Remove from the heat and grind to a coarse powder in a spice grinder. Combine with the salt, five-spices and sugar. Set aside half of the mixture for another time.",
    "Heat four cups of peanut oil in a wok until nearly smoking. Fry the prawns quickly and remove to drain with a large slotted spoon or skimmer.",
    "Heat a dry wok to smoking. Add the prawns and, while tossing them vigorously, sprinkle them very liberally with the salt and pepper mixture. This should take another 30 seconds or so. Turn off the heat, toss quickly with the coriander and serve hot."
