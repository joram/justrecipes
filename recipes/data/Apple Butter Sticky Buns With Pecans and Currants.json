  "instructions": [
    "Lightly grease a large bowl and set it aside. In a small bowl, mix together the milk, 1 teaspoon of the sugar, and the yeast, and set aside until foamy, about 5 minutes.",
    "In the bowl of a stand mixer fitted with the dough hook, combine flour, salt and remaining 3 tablespoons of sugar. Add the milk mixture and egg, and mix the dough on low until almost combined, about 3 minutes. (You may need to help it along with a spatula at first.) Add the 6 tablespoons of butter all at once, and continue to knead until the dough is smooth and elastic, another 3 to 4 minutes. If the dough is very sticky, add up to 1 tablespoon more flour. It should still be very moist but the bottom of the bowl<strong> </strong>should be mostly clean. Transfer dough to the prepared bowl and cover with plastic wrap. Let it stand until it has doubled in size, about 1 hour.",
    "Meanwhile, prepare the topping: Butter a 9-by-2-inch round cake pan. In a small saucepan, combine the butter, brown sugar, maple syrup and salt. Cook over medium heat, stirring occasionally, until the mixture reaches a full boil and looks foamy with large bubbles. Pour the caramel into the prepared cake pan. Sprinkle with the pecans and currants.",
    "Make the filling: In a small bowl, combine the dark brown sugar and cinnamon.",
    "When the dough has doubled, tip it out onto a very lightly floured surface. Knead it once or twice to expel the air, and then roll it with a lightly floured rolling pin into a 10-inch square. Spread the apple butter evenly over the surface and sprinkle with the sugar-cinnamon mixture. Tightly roll the dough, and pinch the top seam closed. With a serrated knife or using a piece of floss, cut the roll crosswise into 8 pieces. Set them in the prepared pan, spirals facing upward.",
    "Cover loosely with plastic wrap, and let the rolls rest until the dough has almost doubled again, about 30 minutes.",
    "Heat the oven to 375 degrees. Uncover the rolls and bake until deep golden brown and set, 28 to 32 minutes. Let cool on a rack for 5 minutes and then carefully cut around the edge with a paring knife and invert the rolls onto a serving plate."
