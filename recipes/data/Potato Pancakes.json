  "instructions": [
    "Peel and grate the potatoes into a bowl of cold water using the large-holed surface of the grater. (Do not grate them until you are ready to cook them.) Drain the potatoes well in a strainer.",
    "Peel the onion and grate on the same grating surface. There should be one cup. Add the onion to the potatoes in a strainer. Blend well.",
    "With a rubber spatula or your hands, push down or squeeze the potato-and-onion mixture to extract the remaining liquid. Place the mixture in a mixing bowl and add salt, pepper and nutmeg. Blend well.",
    "To prepare the pancakes it is best to use two or more nonstick skillets, 6 or 7 inches in diameter. Heat about 1 tablespoon of the oil in each skillet and add 3/4 cup of the potato-onion mixture. Flatten the mixture with a spatula evenly. Cook over medium-high heat about 3 minutes or until the cakes are brown on the bottom. Turn the cakes over, trying not to break them. Cook through for about 3 to 4 minutes longer. Slide the cakes onto a flat surface and keep them warm.",
    "Add one more tablespoon of oil to each skillet and repeat the procedure until all the mixture is used."
