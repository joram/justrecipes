    "Preheat the oven to 425 degrees. Stir together the butter, tomatoes, rosemary, 1 teaspoon of salt, pepper and lemon juice. Using 1 teaspoon of salt for each, salt and pepper the hens inside the cavity and over the skin. Loosen the skin over the breasts and thighs to make pockets. Place 2 tablespoons of butter mixture in each pocket. Rub any remaining mixture over the outside of the hens.",
    "Place the hens in a large roasting pan breast side down. Roast for 20 minutes. Lower the oven temperature to 375 degrees. Roast until just cooked through, about 30 minutes longer. Split the hens in half lengthwise. Place half a hen on each of 8 plates and serve with mascarpone polenta (see recipe)."
