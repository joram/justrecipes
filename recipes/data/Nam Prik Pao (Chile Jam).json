    "Combine the tamarind paste with \n1/2 cup very hot water, and break \nup the paste with a spoon or your \nfingers; soak for a few minutes, \nbreaking up the paste a few more \ntimes if needed. Push the mixture \nthrough a mesh strainer with the back \nof a spoon; set aside the pulp \nthat passes through the strainer, and \ndiscard what remains inside the \nstrainer. Stem and seed the chiles.",
    "Heat the oil in a wok or large \nskillet over medium-high heat until \nhot but not quite smoking. Add \nthe chiles, and cook, stirring, for 15 \nto 20 seconds, making sure they \ndon’t burn. Remove with a slotted \nspoon, and transfer to a plate.",
    "Add the garlic to the oil, and \nfry, stirring frequently, until just golden \nbrown. (It will continue to brown \nafter it’s out of the oil, so don’t go \ntoo dark now.) Transfer to the plate \nwith the chiles. Fry the shallots \nuntil golden brown, and transfer to \nthe plate. Turn off the heat, leaving \nthe oil in the pan. Transfer the chiles, \ngarlic and shallots to a food \nprocessor; pulse, scraping down \nthe sides as necessary, until \nthe mixture turns into a paste (no \nneed to make it totally smooth).",
    "Turn the heat under the pan to \nmedium. Add the shrimp paste, and \ncook, stirring and breaking it up, \nfor about a minute or 2. Add the palm \nsugar, and cook, stirring, until it \ndissolves. Add the chile, garlic and \nshallot mixture, the tamarind pulp \nand 2 tablespoons of the fish sauce. \nStir to combine, turn the heat to low \nand cook, stirring occasionally so the \nbottom of the pan doesn’t burn, \nuntil it thickens slightly, 2 or 3 minutes. \nTaste the mixture; if it still needs salt, \nadd more fish sauce, a little at a time.",
    "You can store the jam (and the oil) \nin a jar in the fridge or freezer; use \nit in stir-fries or soups, spoon it on top \nof rice or noodles, spread it on toast \nor use it as the base for the yum yai \ndressing (recipe online)."
