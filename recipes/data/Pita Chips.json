    "Preheat the oven to 350 degrees.",
    "Slice each pita in half to divide it into two flat disks. If that is too tedious, stack six of rounds, and simply cut off the edges; then repeat three times. Next, cut each disk into quarters, yielding 8 sections from each pita.",
    "Put the sections onto baking sheets, and bake them for 7 or 8 minutes, until toasted. Cool, then store in a tightly tied plastic bag until you are ready to use them."
