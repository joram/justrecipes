    "Prepare the grill for direct grilling and heat over high. ",
    "Working on a large baking sheet, brush the zucchini all over with oil, then season generously with salt and pepper. ",
    "Once the grill is heated, add the zucchini to the grates in an even layer, leaving about 1 inch between to avoid crowding. Cook, uncovered, until grill-marked and crisp-tender, 3 to 4 minutes per side. (The zucchini should tenderize in just the amount of time it takes to develop grill marks.) ",
    "In a small bowl, stir the ricotta, if using, with a couple tablespoons of water until extra creamy; season with salt and pepper. Spread the ricotta mixture on a platter, then top with the grilled zucchini, piling it organically to gain some height. Though you need no garnish, you can top with fresh herbs, capers, a flurry of lemon zest and a squeeze of lemon juice if you are feeling fancy. Drizzle with olive oil and serve warm or at room temperature."
