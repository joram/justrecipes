  "instructions": [
    "Place the milk, cream, salt, and citric acid in a pot set over medium heat and heat to 195°F (91°C). Stir the mixture as it heats so the milk and the forming curds do not scorch on the bottom of the pan. Alternatively, seal all the ingredients in a vacuum bag and cook in a circulating water bath set at 195°F (91°C) for 30 minutes. When the curds and whey separate, turn off the heat and let rest for 10 minutes.",
    "Strain the curds through a cheesecloth-lined colander set inside a bowl. Let the cheese drain to a consistency you like, anywhere from 10 minutes to 2 hours. Remove from the strainer and let cool to room temperature. Transfer the ricotta to an airtight container. The cheese will keep in the refrigerator for up to 1 week. Reserve the whey for poaching meats and fish or making consommé."
