  "instructions": [
    "Cut the tomatoes across their horizontal equators, and over the sink, scoop out some of their seeds and juice without completely disemboweling them.",
    "Heat a cast-iron pan or grill pan or grill big enough to fit all the tomatoes in one or two rounds. Lightly brush or drizzle your pan with olive oil. Cook the tomatoes in a single layer, cut sides down, for 3 to 4 minutes, until they just start to collapse or buckle when they are plucked at with tongs and their cut sides are browned or even a touch blackened.",
    "Turn off the heat, and turn the tomatoes over, leaving them for 3 minutes on the second side and then removing them, cut sides up, to a plate. Lightly salt the cut sides.",
    "In a mortar and pestle or on a cutting board, pound the garlic to a paste with a large pinch of salt — about 1/2 teaspoon. When you have a fairly smooth paste, mix in the chopped herbs and olive oil. Taste. Adjust salt until the paste is very well seasoned.",
    "Divide the herb paste among the cut sides of the tomatoes, using it all. There should be a thick, herby blanket on each. Eat warm or at room temperature or cool."
