    "Combine the rum, vermouth, bay leaf reduction and bitters in a mixing glass with ice, and stir thoroughly. Strain into a chilled cocktail glass, then add the bay leaf and several blueberries.",
    "To flame the orange peel into the drink, cut a thumb-size wedge of peel from an orange. Holding a lighted match or lighter in one hand, squeeze the orange peel with the other hand over the flame so that the oils ignite as they pass through the flame. (This can require practice; an unflamed twist of orange will also suffice.) Serve."
