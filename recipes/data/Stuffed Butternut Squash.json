  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oven to 400. Peel and trim the squash; separate the necks from the\nbases. Scoop out the seeds from the bases, and reserve. Roughly dice the necks into pieces no bigger than 1/2 inch.",
    "Rub the hollowed out bases inside and out with olive oil; sprinkle with salt and\npepper. Stand them up on a rimmed baking sheet, and roast, flipping once, until\nthey are browned all over and you can easily pierce the flesh with the tip of\na sharp knife, about 1 hour.",
    "Meanwhile, soak the porcinis in 1 cup hot water until soft; remove, and chop them, reserving the liquid. Put 3 tablespoons olive oil in a large skillet over medium-high heat. When the oil is hot, add the onion and cook, stirring occasionally until it begins to soften â€” about 5 minutes. Add the chopped\nsquash and porcinis, and sprinkle with salt and pepper. Cook, stirring occasionally until the squash is nicely browned, 8 to 12 minutes.",
    "Add the red wine, stirring to scrape up any browned bits from the bottom, and let it bubble away until it almost disappears. Add the porcini soaking liquid (leave any sediment behind) and the stock. Bring to a boil, then reduce to a simmer. Cover partly and cook, adding more liquid if the pan gets too dry, until the squash is very tender, 10 to 15 minutes; taste, and adjust seasoning.",
    "Put 1 tablespoon olive oil in a separate small skillet. When the oil is hot, add the\nsquash seeds and cook, stirring occasionally until golden brown and crisp,\n4 to 6 minutes. Turn off the heat, add the chopped sage, lemon zest and a\nsprinkle of salt and pepper, and toss.",
    "When the squash bases are done, spoon the chopped squash mixture into the cavities (save the leftover stuffing, or serve it on the side). Sprinkle the squash seeds over the top, and serve."
