    "Mix together the peppercorns and the salt in a small bowl. Transfer the mixture to a medium-sized skillet and toast over medium heat, stirring constantly, just until the mixture is fragrant and smoking and the salt begins to turn golden, five to eight minutes. Be very careful not to let the mixture burn.",
    "Remove from the heat and let cool. Then grind the pepper-salt until fine and sieve to remove any large pieces. Store in an airtight container."
