  "instructions": [
    "Bring a large saucepan of water to a boil. Meanwhile, mix the vinegar, 1 tablespoon honey and 1 teaspoon salt in a small bowl. Add the daikon and press into the mixture to submerge as much as possible. Let stand until ready to serve, mixing occasionally.",
    "Add 1/4 cup salt to the boiling water. Add the snap peas and cook just until bright green and tender, about 30 seconds to 1 minute. Using a spider or slotted spoon, transfer to a colander and immediately rinse under cold water until cool. Drain well.",
    "Add the noodles to the boiling water. Cook, stirring occasionally, until just tender, 4 to 8 minutes. Drain, rinse under cold water until cool and drain again.",
    "While the noodles cook, whisk the soy sauce, sesame oil, red-pepper flakes and remaining 2 tablespoons honey in a large bowl. Add the chicken, soba and snap peas and toss until evenly coated. Season to taste with salt.",
    "Divide among bowls. Drain the daikon pickles and arrange on top, then garnish with the scallions, sesame seeds and additional red-pepper flakes."
