    "Put potato in a saucepan and add cold water to cover and salt. Bring to boil and cook until tender, 20 to 30 minutes. Drain.",
    "Heat 3 tablespoons oil in a saucepan and add half of the onions. Cook, stirring, until golden brown. Add meat, breaking up lumps with edge of a heavy metal spoon. When meat loses raw look, add salt, pepper and garlic powder. Add the water and cook, stirring, until liquid evaporates, about 5 minutes. Drain thoroughly to remove excess oil.",
    "Peel potato and grate on medium-size blade of a grater into a bowl. There should be about 1 1/2 cups. Add remaining chopped onion, green pepper and meat mixture. Blend well.",
    "Lay out egg roll skins, one at a time, on flat surface. Rub outer edges with water. Spoon one-quarter of meat mixture onto each skin, shaping in triangle over half the skin. Fold over other half of skin to enclose meat. Press to seal margins.",
    "Heat 1/2 cup of oil in a skillet and add filled skins (this may require two or more steps). Cook until golden brown on both sides, about 2 minutes or less. As turnovers are cooked, drain on paper towels. Cut each in half to make two triangles of equal size. Serve with yogurt spooned over."
