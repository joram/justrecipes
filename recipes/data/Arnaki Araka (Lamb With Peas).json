    "Pat the lamb dry with paper towels. Put it in a deep skillet over medium heat and cook 5 minutes to remove excess moisture. Add the butter and the scallions and stir. Cook until scallions start to become translucent, about 5 minutes.",
    "Add the tomatoes, the tomato juice and enough water to bring the liquid 2/3 of the way up the meat. Add 1 teaspoon salt, cover, reduce the heat and simmer for 30 minutes. Turn the meat and continue to cook until it is tender but not falling apart, another 30 minutes.",
    "Add the peas and the dill to the skillet and continue to cook the lamb, covered, until the peas are tender, about 6 minutes. Season to taste with salt and pepper and serve."
