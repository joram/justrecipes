  "instructions": [
    "Using paper towels, thoroughly pat the bird dry on a large rimmed baking sheet. Cut slits in the skin between the breast and the legs, exposing some of the meat and allowing the legs to open up a little bit, then very generously season the whole turkey inside and out with salt and pepper. Orient the bird breast-side up on the baking sheet and refrigerate, uncovered, at least overnight or up to 48 hours.",
    "Several hours before cooking, remove the turkey from the refrigerator and let it sit, uncovered, so it can come to room temperature.",
    "Arrange an oven rack in the center position and heat oven to 325 degrees.",
    "Use paper towels to absorb any liquid inside the cavity or on the baking sheet, then flip the bird so it’s breast-side down. Transfer the baking sheet to the oven and roast for 1 hour, then remove from the oven and use tongs to carefully flip the turkey so it’s breast-side up. (If the skin sticks to the baking sheet, use a metal spatula to scrape and help release it.)",
    "Continue to roast until the thickest part of the breast registers 150 degrees, another 1 hour to 1 hour 20 minutes, then remove from the oven. (Carry-over cooking will ensure the breast hits 160 degrees as it rests.) Let the turkey rest for at least 45 minutes (tenting with foil, if needed), then transfer to a cutting board and carve. Any leftovers will keep, stored airtight in the refrigerator, for up to 4 days."
