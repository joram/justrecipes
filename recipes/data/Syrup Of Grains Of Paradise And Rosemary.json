    "In a small saucepan, mix together all the ingredients plus 1/2 cup water. Bring to a boil, then reduce heat, and simmer partly covered, for 10 minutes. Let mixture cool, then taste, adjusting sweetness and acidity as necessary. Let mixture steep longer if more flavor is desired. Strain through a fine-mesh strainer, and store refrigerated. Sprinkle over fresh fruit, like mango or strawberries."
