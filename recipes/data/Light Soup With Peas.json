    "In a small saucepan, bring 1 cup of the broth to a boil with the rice. Cover, lower the heat, and simmer for 13 minutes.",
    "In a medium saucepan, add half of the peas to the remaining broth, and bring to a boil. Lower the heat, and simmer for 5 minutes. Strain, reserving the liquid.",
    "In a blender, puree peas with a little reserved liquid. Whisk together remaining liquid and the puree. Season with salt and pepper. The soup can be made ahead up to this point and refrigerated for up to 2 days.",
    "Return the soup to the stove, and bring to a boil. Stir in the remaining peas (and the fiddleheads, if using). Return to a boil, lower the heat, and simmer for 3 minutes. Add the rice, and simmer for 2 minutes longer. If using the asparagus instead of the ferns, add them and the rice after the peas have simmered for 3 minutes. Simmer for 2 minutes longer. Serve immediately."
