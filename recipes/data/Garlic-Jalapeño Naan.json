    "Heat 2¼ cups of the milk until hot but not boiling (120°F to 130°F). Pour hot milk into a food processor fitted with a dough blade or a stand mixer fitted with a dough hook. Add date paste and yeast; stir to combine. Sprinkle 2 tablespoons of the flour over milk mixture. Cover and set aside in a warm place at least 10 minutes or until frothy.",
    "In a large bowl combine the remaining 3½ cups flour and the salt. Add flour mixture to milk mixture and process or mix on low speed 2 to 3 minutes or until a dough begins to form. Add half of the onion, garlic, and jalapeño. Process or mix 2 to 3 minutes more or until dough starts to pull away from the sides of the bowl and is not sticky.",
    "Transfer dough to bowl and cover with a clean, damp cloth. Set aside in a warm place 45 to 60 minutes or until dough doubles in size.",
    "Preheat oven to 525°F. Place a pizza stone or an upside-down baking sheet on the oven’s top rack. Line three baking sheets with parchment paper; dust each liberally with flour.",
    "Transfer dough to a lightly floured work surface. Divide dough into 16 equal portions and roll them into balls. Use a rolling pin to roll balls into 6x4-inch ovals and transfer to prepared baking sheets. Loosely cover with damp towels and set aside in a warm place to rise 10 minutes.",
    "In a medium bowl stir together the remaining ¼ cup milk; the remaining onion, garlic, and jalapeño; the cilantro; and lemon juice. Dust a pizza peel, plate, or upside-down baking sheet with flour.",
    "Place two dough ovals on pizza peel. Spread a layer of milk mixture on each. Quickly transfer ovals onto the hot pizza stone or baking sheet in oven. Bake 90 seconds or until naans puff up and show slight browning on top. (Don’ t let them get too brown or they will be dry on the inside.) Transfer to a platter lined with a clean kitchen towel; wrap to keep them warm. Repeat with remaining dough and milk mixture. Serve warm."
