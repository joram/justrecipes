    "Make the dipping sauce:\n<br/>\nChild: To remove some of the salt from the beans, put them in a small bowl of warm water for 2 minutes. Rinse in a small colander or a strainer, and repeat 3 times.\n<br/>\nAdult: Mince garlic cloves. Trim ends of chives.\n<br/>\nChild: In another small bowl, mix beans and garlic, and give to the adult. Using a pair of small blunt kitchen scissors, cut chives into tiny pieces.\n<br/>\nAdult: In a small frying pan over medium heat, heat oil until shimmering, and add beans and garlic. Stir until they begin to sizzle, about 1 minute, then reduce heat to low, add soy sauce and cook for 2 minutes. Pour into a small bowl.\n<br/>\nChild: Garnish sauce with chives.",
    "Make the summer rolls:\n<br/>\nAdult: Trim ends of chives.\n<br/>\nChild: Count out 16 chives and, using kitchen scissors, cut them in half. Tear basil leaves in half.\n<br/>\nAdult: Mince remaining chives and set aside for garnish. Cut bell pepper in half lengthwise, discard seeds, and cut 8 slices 1/2 inch wide. (Reserve remaining bell pepper for another use.)",
    "Adult: Place a wide shallow bowl or baking pan on the counter and add 1 to 2 inches of cold water. Slide a rice wrapper into the water until pliable but not soggy, about 10 to 30 seconds. Transfer wrapper to a large plate.\n<br/>\nChild: In the center of the wrapper, place a row (about 4 pieces) of basil, mint (about 5 leaves), cilantro (about 6 leaves) and chives (about 4 pieces). Add 10 bean sprouts and a strip of red bell pepper.\n<br/>\nAdult: Roll up wrapper halfway to cover filling, then tuck in ends of wrapper. Continue rolling, wrapping tightly. Place roll, seam-side down, on a serving plate. Continue to make 8 rolls.\n<br/>\nChild: Garnish rolls with minced chives; serve with dipping sauce."
