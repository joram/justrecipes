    "Place the eggplant rounds on a double thickness of paper towels and sprinkle them with the salt. Let stand for 1 hour. Pat the eggplant dry. Heat the olive oil in a large skillet, preferably cast iron. Add the eggplant rounds in batches, cooking until they are blackened on both sides, about 3 to 4 minutes. Set aside.",
    "Heat the glaze in a medium-size saucepan. Whisk in the black beans, oyster sauce and pepper. Cook until the sauce is reduced to 1/2 cup. Place the eggplant rounds on a broiler pan and brush the tops generously with the black bean sauce and broil about 1 minute. Turn and brush the other side of each round with the sauce. Broil about 1 minute. Divide the eggplant among 4 plates and top with any remaining sauce. Sprinkle with scallions and serve immediately."
