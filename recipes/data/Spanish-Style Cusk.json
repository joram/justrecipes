  "instructions": [
    "Heat the oil until hot, but not smoking, in one or two skillets with lids. Add the scallions and garlic, and saute them for 1 minute. Then add the peppers and zucchini and saute for 1 minute.",
    "Add the salt, pepper and tomato to the skillets, and mix well. Add the pieces of fish into the mixture, completely embedding them in the vegetables. Cover, reduce the heat to low, and cook the fish for about 10 minutes (more or less, depending on the thickness of the fillets). The cusk should be just cooked through; overcooking tends to dry it out.",
    "Serve immediately with the rice and cumin."
