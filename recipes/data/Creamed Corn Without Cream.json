  "instructions": [
    "Grate the corn on the large holes of a box grater placed over a wide bowl. If you wrap plastic wrap around the 3 other sides of the grater, the splashes will go into the bowl.",
    "Melt 1 tablespoon of the butter in a medium saucepan over medium heat, and add shallots if using. Cook, stirring, until shallot is tender and fragrant, about 2 minutes, and add the corn and salt to taste. Cook for 5 minutes, stirring often, until the mixture is sweet and creamy. Taste and adjust salt. Stir in the remaining tablespoon of butter and remove from the heat. Serve hot, garnished with fresh herbs if desired."
