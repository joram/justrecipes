    "Set a rack in the bottom third of the oven and heat the oven to 400 degrees. Line a large sheet pan with parchment paper. In the warming oven or a microwave, soften the butter. Spread butter edge to edge on 4 slices of the bread. (You may not need all the butter, depending on the size of your bread.) Place the 4 slices butter-side down on half the prepared sheet pan. Top with the melting cheese, then top with the remaining 4 slices of bread. ",
    "Place on the bottom rack and cook until the bottoms are light golden and the cheese is melted, 7 to 9 minutes. ",
    "Remove pan from the oven and sprinkle a thin layer of the hard cheese on the empty side of the pan. Spread out the cheese to create holes and lacy edges, like snowflakes, for more crisping. Use a spatula to flip the sandwiches onto the cheese so the tops of the sandwiches adhere to it. Return to the bottom rack and cook until the exterior cheese is light golden and crisp, 5 to 7 minutes. Let cool slightly before eating."
