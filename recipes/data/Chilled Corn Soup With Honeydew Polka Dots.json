  "instructions": [
    "Grate kernels from 4 ears corn into a large bowl, using coarse side of grater (there should be 1 cup grated corn, including juices); discard cobs. Using paring knife, cut kernels from remaining 6 ears (there should be 3 cups); set aside. Break 4 cobs in half, and combine with grated corn, chicken broth and water in 1 1/2 gallon stockpot; discard 2 remaining cobs. Bring to simmer, and cook, covered, for 10 minutes, stirring occasionally. Remove cobs from broth with tongs, and discard.",
    "Pour mixture into blender, and pur&#233;e until completely smooth. Return to pot. Stir in whole kernels, bring to a simmer, and cook until corn is crisp-tender, about 5 minutes. Transfer soup to bowl (not plastic). Stir in salt and cayenne. Cover, and refrigerate, or stir over ice water bath at room temperature until very cold (about 5 hours in refrigerator, 1 hour over ice).",
    "Halve and seed melon. With melon baller, make tiny balls (there should be about 1 1/4 cups) or cut melon into dice. Cover melon balls and chill over ice until ready to use (up to 1 hour before serving).",
    "To serve, stir buttermilk into soup. Taste, and adjust seasoning. Toss melon balls with chervil or basil, and sprinkle with salt. Divide melon balls among 6 chilled shallow bowls. Pour cold soup around melon."
