  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 425 degrees. Using a mandoline or sharp knife, slice potatoes about 1/8-inch thick. Place in a very large bowl, and add butter, thyme and salt and pepper to taste. Toss well until all slices are well coated with butter and seasonings.",
    "Reserve about a dozen of the best-looking slices for top layer. Arrange a layer of slightly overlapping slices in 10-inch round gratin dish, skillet or other shallow ovenproof pan. Layer potatoes until all are used, topping gratin with reserved slices.",
    "Place a sheet of heavy-duty foil directly on top of potatoes. Place pan in oven, and place a heavy pan slightly smaller in diameter than first pan directly on foil. Bake for 30 minutes.",
    "Remove top pan, and carefully peel away foil. (If necessary, use a spatula to help separate foil from potatoes.) Continue baking until potatoes are soft and top is almost caramelized, 20 to 30 minutes longer. Cut into wedges and serve hot."
