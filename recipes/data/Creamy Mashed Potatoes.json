  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 450 degrees.",
    "Individually wrap potatoes in aluminum foil and arrange on a baking sheet. Roast until potatoes are very soft and don’t resist in the center when pierced with a knife, about 1 hour. Unwrap potatoes, halve lengthwise and let stand until just cool enough to handle (but still very warm), about 10 minutes. Peel off and discard skins. ",
    "Rice potatoes through a food mill or ricer into a large deep skillet or pot. Add milk and butter, and stir over low heat until mashed potatoes are creamy and warmed through, about 3 minutes. Season with salt. Transfer to a serving bowl and serve warm."
