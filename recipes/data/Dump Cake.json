  "instructions": [
    "Heat oven to 350 degrees with the rack in the center position.",
    "Add the cherry pie filling and the crushed pineapple, including any juices, to a 9-by-13-inch (3-quart) baking dish. Using a spatula, evenly spread the mixture across the baking dish (there is no need to mix it). Scatter the cake mix evenly on top, without stirring, and smooth the top.",
    "Melt the butter and drizzle evenly on top of the cake mix. If there are any dry spots, spread the butter out wherever it pools (gently tilting the baking dish works well here).Â ",
    "Bake on the center rack until the top is golden brown and the fruit is bubbling, 45 to 50 minutes. Serve warm, with whipped cream or vanilla ice cream, if desired."
