    "Preheat broiler. Peel the bananas and arrange them in one layer in a gratin dish. Pour the lemon juice over them, then roll them in the juice to prevent them from discoloring. Sprinkle them with brown sugar.",
    "Place the bananas under the broiler, about 4 inches from the heat, and broil them until they are brown on top, about 4 minutes. Turn the bananas over and place them again under the broiler for 3 to 4 minutes, until brown on top. They should be soft at this point when pierced with a fork.",
    "Cool the bananas until they are lukewarm, sprinkle them with the rum, if desired, and serve immediately."
