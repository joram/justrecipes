  "instructions": [
    "Place the first 4 ingredients of the soup in a nonreactive pot and gently simmer for 5 to 10 minutes. The peaches should be very tender. Place all in a blender and pur√©e until smooth, strain and add sugar to desired taste (you might not need all of it depending on the sweetness of the peaches). Ice down until chilled and reserve.",
    "Mix the cherries, chopped pistachios and peach well in a small bowl. Portion out the mixture into the centers of eight serving bowls, forming flat rectangles about 3 inches long by 1 1/2 inches wide. Pour 2 to 3 ounces of cold soup around the mix in each bowl, then top each rectangle with 1 quenelle of cherry sorbet and 2 quenelles of peach sorbet. Sprinkle with whole pistachios and garnish with mint."
