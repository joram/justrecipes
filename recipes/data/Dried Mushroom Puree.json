  "instructions": [
    "Combine mushrooms with 2 1/2 cups water in 4- or 6-cup saucepan, and turn heat to medium-high. Bring to boil, then adjust the heat so the mixture simmers gently. Cook until mushrooms are tender, 15 minutes.",
    "Remove mushrooms with slotted spoon, and place in container of blender. Strain liquid from pan through a paper towel placed in a sieve, or through a couple layers of cheesecloth; there will be about 1 cup. Add most of the liquid to the mushrooms, and puree, adding remaining liquid, if necessary. (Reserve some liquid, if making a risotto or grain dish.)",
    "Season to taste with salt and pepper; serve, or cover and refrigerate. Bring back to room temperature before serving."
